::: {.incremental}
- [Treatments]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} delivered using [technology (e.g., smartphones)]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} that use [machine learning algorithms]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} to [recommend engagement]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} with particular in-app modules at the [optimal time]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"}

## How can smart DTx help manage alcohol use? {.smaller}
::: {.incremental}
- Algorithms could be developed:
  1. ...to [predict]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} an oncoming lapse (*single instance of use*)
  2. ...to encourage use of specific tools to [minimize risk]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} of that lapse occurring based on factors *specifically relevant to that individual*
- In other words, these algorithms have the potential to predict both [when]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} and [why]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} a lapse may occur.

## Lapse as intervention target {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
- Chronic, recurrent patterns of relapse back to harmful alcohol use are a common occurrence during the recovery process
- [Relapse]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} as an intervention target?
  - However, term is inconsistently defined in literature
- [Lapse:]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} a single instance of goal-inconsistent use that may lead to relapse
  - Clearly defined
  - Easy to observe
  - Always precede relapse
  - Can be tied to clinically meaningful events (e.g., abstinence violation effect)
:::

Significance
:::

## Lapse as intervention target {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
- Despite clear definition, factors which precipitate lapse change both [person-by-person]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} and [moment-by-moment]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"}
  - Importance of understanding not only [when]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} a lapse may happen, but also [why]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"}, to facilitate optimally effective intervention
- Measures which seek to quantify risk of lapse must provide the [appropriate level of granularity]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"}

## The role of location in lapse

:::{.incremental}
- Location important in lapse (e.g., environmental cues, perceived riskiness of a setting)
- Coping skills that target substance-associated contexts integrated within several treatment strategies like mindfulness-based relapse prevention
:::

::: footer
Significance
:::

## The role of location in lapse {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
Examples of facets captured within location:

- [Associations with others]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} (or lack thereof, e.g., social isolation)
- [Associations with previous drinking behaviors]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} (e.g., whether or not alcohol is present)
- [Associations with affect]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} (i.e., negative versus positive emotions tied to a given location)
  - May play different roles in lapse risk both within and across individuals.
:::

Significance
:::

## Geolocation data for lapse prediction {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
- Location information can be encoded using [geolocation data]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"}
  - Quantify spatial positioning and movement across time
- Smartphones, smartwatches automatically and continually collect these data. 
  - Paired with increasing rates of smartphone ownership, suggests that there is [high potential for mental health applications]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"}
- Geolocation data identified as useful for both understanding the [precipitants]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} to harmful substance use and its [effective treatment]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"}

## Geolocation data for lapse prediction {.smaller}

::: {.column width="40%" .fragment fragment-index=1 style="align-items: center;"}
Within the [substance use]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} literature:

- Examine [risky locations]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"}

  - Influence of neighborhood characteristics on use
  
  - Physical proximity to locations of past harmful use (e.g., bars)
  
- Enable real-time notifications about locations to their users
:::

::: {.column width="40%" .fragment fragment-index=2}
Within the [affective science]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} literature:

- Focus on [mood and behavior]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} and emergence of mood states

  - Loneliness and isolation
  
  - Associations of positive affect and seeking out novel environments
  
  - Quantifying depressive symptoms

## Algorithmic fairness {style="font-size:0.6em;"}

::: {.column width="40%" .fragment fragment-index=1 style="align-items: center;"}
[While the data set for this study has a range of age and sex representation (21-72 years of age, 49% women), it is primarily white (86.8%) and non-Hispanic (97.4%).]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"}

- Our models will not have as wide a range of individuals to learn from for making predictions of lapse as compared to white, non-Hispanic participants
- Performance of these models for racialized minority individuals may therefore be less accurate as a result
:::

::: {.column width="40%" .fragment fragment-index=2}
[The AUD literature has historically been built upon research developed with male, predominantly white, participants.]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"}

- AUD research and its theory have been developed from a particular perspective using a particular group of individuals
  - Variables that we decide are important to measure and input into our models in this study are informed by our knowledge of this AUD theory
- Models will have equivalent representation across sex, but cannot assume this will compensate for broader societal context
:::

Significance
:::

## How to evaluate fairness? {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
- No concrete standards of reporting of algorithmic fairness have been delineated
  - Critically important: ultimate goal of these algorithms is to be implemented in patient contexts
- [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) 80% rule:]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} which states that hiring rates of individuals from protected groups (e.g., people of color, women) should be at least 80% that of white men
  - Applied in the context of algorithmic fairness, this would be something like model performance being at least 80% of the best-performing group
:::

::: footer
Significance
:::

## How to evaluate fairness? {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
- Many established metrics for statistically assessing algorithmic fairness
- Predicated on the assignment of a ["privileged"]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} and ["non-privileged"]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} group
  - Measures such as accuracy can be examined between those two groups
  - Can be repeated over many combinations of privileged and non-privileged groups to assess model performance across various identities
:::

::: footer
Significance
:::

## Fairness and AUD {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
- Risk, access to and engagement with treatment, and negative consequences from drinking vary across [socioeconomic status, race, and sex]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} in AUD
- Location plays an important role in contributing to mental health inequities in general
  - In the context of substance use, exposure to substances, neighborhood disadvantage, and barriers to treatment stratified by location all contribute to the initiation and maintenance of substance use disorders
- [Inequities are not shared equally across the population]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"}

## Procedure {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
- Five in-person visits, daily surveys, and continuous passive monitoring of geolocation data
- Screening and enrollment visits:
  - Participants consented, learned how to manage location sharing (i.e., turn off location sharing when desired), and reported frequently visited locations
- Three follow-up visits one month apart
  - Asked questions about frequently visited (\>2 times during the course of the previous month) locations
- Debriefed at the third and final follow-up visit

## Measures - Lapses {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
- Next-day lapse occurrence will be predicted in 24-hour rolling windows
- [Lapse]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} and [no lapse]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} occurrences will be identified from the daily survey question, ["Have you drank any alcohol that you have not yet reported?"]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"}
  - Participants who responded [yes]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} to this question were then asked to report the date and hour of the start and the end of the drinking episode
- Windows will be excluded if no alcohol use occurred within the window but did occur within six hours of the start or end of the window for label fidelity

## Measures - Geolocation data {.smaller}
:::{.incremental}
- Participants downloaded either the Moves app or the FollowMee app during the intake visit
  - Moves was bought-out and subsequently deprecated while the study was ongoing (July 2018) and data collection continued using FollowMee until the end of the study
- Both apps continuously tracked location via GPS and WiFi positioning technology
- Participants did not have to consent to location tracking and were instructed on how to turn off location sharing at-will

## Measures - Fairness subgrouping

:::{.incremental}
- Defined on the basis of personal individual characteristics that are specifically associated with treatment disparities in AUD
- Characteristics will be assessed using this method to ensure the development of a model that does not further exacerbate existing treatment disparities.
:::

<!--not sure if I need this slide-->

::: footer
Approach
:::

## Feature engineering - sources

Three raw data sources:

:::{.incremental}
1. Demographic characteristics relevant to treatment disparities in AUD collected at intake
2. Day at prediction window onset
3. Geolocation data collected the prior day
:::

::: footer
Approach
:::

## Feature engineering - coding

:::{.incremental}
- Quantitative feature for age
- Dummy-coded features for race/ethnicity, marital status, education, and sex
- Dummy-coded features indicating time of day (5pm - midnight versus any other time) and day of the week
  - As a comparison to the geolocation model, a baseline model will also be developed utilizing only the time-of-day dummy-coded features to predict lapse
:::

::: footer
Approach
:::

## Feature engineering - geolocation

:::{.incremental}
- Features from geolocation data will be generated that both do and do not utilize contextual information
- Examples of potential features generated with contextual data:
  - Isolation (extended time spent at home)

## Algorithm development & performance

- Several classification candidate machine learning algorithms will be considered and will be trained and assessed using participant-grouped, nested *k*-fold cross-validation

<!--put in nested kfold cross val figure!-->

## Algorithm development & performance {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
- Primary performance metric for model selection and evaluation will be area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (auROC)
  - Indexes the probability that the model will predict a higher score for a randomly selected positive case (lapse) relative to a randomly selected negative case (no lapse)
- Best model configuration will be selected using median auROC across all validation sets
- Secondary performance metrics: sensitivity, specificity, balanced accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV)

- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values will be computed as our interpretability metric to identify the relative importance of different features in each final algorithm
  - Measure the unique contribution of features in an algorithm's predictions
- Highly important features represent relevant, actionable potential antecedents to lapse (and therefore points of intervention) that will be relevant in the future development of a smart DTx
- Descriptive analyses: standard errors or other indices of uncertainty for importance scores not available for SHAP values

- Finally, the best-performing geolocation model will be compared to the baseline model
  - [Baseline model:]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} will use only the time-of-day dummy-coded features to predict lapse
- Bayesian hierarchical generalized linear model will be used to estimate the posterior probability distributions and 95% Bayesian credible intervals (CIs) for auROC between the baseline (time-of-day) and geolocation models

## Algorithmic fairness {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
- Several fairness metrics will be assessed across demographic characteristics implicated in treatment disparities, such as the true positive rate (TPR), true negative rate (TNR), and accuracy
  - Can be calculated using open source R packages
- Differences in classification are calculated by first splitting the sample by group, where one is the [privileged group]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} and the other is the [unprivileged group]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"}, and then examining assigned outcomes ([lapse]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} or [no lapse]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"})
- Bayesian hierarchical generalized linear model will be used to estimate the posterior probability distributions and 95% Bayesian CIs for auROC across different subgroups

## Proposed study {.smaller}

My proposed first-year project will apply machine learning to [predict lapse]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} in AUD [utilizing geolocation data]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} with the aim of advancing both [prediction]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} and [explanatory]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} efforts in AUD.

:::{.incremental}
- I will build a model to predict oncoming lapse with an almost entirely passive data stream for individuals with a recovery goal of abstinence [(Aim 1)]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"}
- I will evaluate the best-performing model and examine what geolocation features are most predictive of an oncoming lapse [(Aim 2)]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"}
- I will critically examine the fairness of the best performing model [(Aim 3)]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"}

## Contribution to theory {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
- Identify the most [predictive]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} features which contribute to lapse from a minimally burdensome and continuously collected data source, geolocation data
- Utilize features created by leveraging modeling techniques from both the substance use and affective science subdisciplines, resulting in broadly relevant [transdiagnostic]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} constructs
- Provide a critical evaluation of model performance beyond AUC by including examination of algorithmic fairness.
  - Advocate for [transparency]{style="color:#b22222; font-weight:bold"} in reporting fairness metrics alongside standard measures of model performance
