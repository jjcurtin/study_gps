## Background (54 words)

Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a chronic, relapsing condition. Anticipating lapses and understanding their precursors can be difficult for individuals in recovery. Moreover, there is great heterogeneity within and between people. Machine learning techniques and geolocation data can be leveraged to predict and explain alcohol lapse in order to provide continued monitoring and support.

## Methods (82 words)

One hundred and forty-six participants (male=50.7%; mean age=40.9; white=87%, non-Hispanic=97.3%) in early AUD recovery (1â€“8 weeks of abstinence) provided continuous geolocation data for three months. An XGBoost algorithm was trained to predict next-day lapse from geolocation data. Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (auROC) curve was used as the primary performance metric. Shapley values were computed to evaluate global importance of each feature category. Posterior probability distributions of auROCs were evaluated across race, sex, age, and income to evaluate fair performance.

## Results (64 words)

The median auROC was 0.714 (95% CI [0.70-0.73]). Shapley values revealed three important features: time spent at risky locations, time spent across location types, and time spent at locations with varying levels of alcohol availability. Differential model performance was identified across subgroups (probability >.95), such that auROCs were higher for white (range=0.027-0.084), male (range=0.013-0.060), younger participants (range=0.079-0.133), and those above the poverty line (range=0.033-0.078).

## Conclusions (49 words)

Geolocation data are able to predict next-day alcohol lapse at a fair level of performance, though not equally across demographic subgroups. This study represents foundational work exploring the predictive signal, important features, and fairness of this model for integration into a monitoring and support system for individuals in recovery.
