<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mobile technology for mental health assessment;,citation_abstract=Assessment and outcome monitoring are critical for the effective detection and treatment of mental illness. Traditional methods of capturing social, functional, and behavioral data are limited to the information that patients report back to their health care provider at selected points in time. As a result, these data are not accurate accounts of day-to-day functioning, as they are often influenced by biases in self-report. Mobile technology (mobile applications on smartphones, activity bracelets) has the potential to overcome such problems with traditional assessment and provide information about patient symptoms, behavior, and functioning in real time. Although the use of sensors and apps are widespread, several questions remain in the field regarding the reliability of off-the-shelf apps and sensors, use of these tools by consumers, and provider use of these data in clinical decision-making.;,citation_author=Patricia A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Using a mobile health application to reduce alcohol consumption: A mixed-methods evaluation of the drinkaware track &amp;amp;amp; calculate units application;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Smartphone applications (&amp;amp;quot;apps&amp;quot;) offer promise as tools to help people monitor and reduce their alcohol consumption. To date, few evaluations of alcohol reduction apps exist, with even fewer considering apps already available to the public. The aim of this study was to evaluate an existing publically available app, designed by Drinkaware, a UK-based alcohol awareness charity. METHODS: We adopted a mixed-methods design, analysing routinely collected app usage data to explore user characteristics and patterns of usage. Following this, in-depth interviews were conducted with a sub-sample of app users to examine perceptions of acceptability, usability and perceived effectiveness, as well as to provide recommendations on how to improve the app. RESULTS: One hundred nineteen thousand seven hundred thirteen people downloaded and entered data into the app over a 13-month period. High attrition was observed after 1 week. Users who engaged with the app tended to be &quot;high risk&quot; drinkers and to report being motivated &quot;to reduce drinking&quot; at the point of first download. In those who consistently engaged with the app over time, self-reported alcohol consumption levels reduced, with most change occurring in the first week of usage. Our qualitative findings indicate satisfaction with the usability of the app, but mixed feedback was given regarding individual features. Users expressed conflicting views concerning the type of feedback and notifications that the app currently provides. A common preference was expressed for more personalised content. CONCLUSIONS: The Drinkaware app is a useful tool to support behaviour change in individuals who are already motivated and committed to reducing their alcohol consumption. The Drinkaware app would benefit from greater personalisation and tailoring to promote longer term use. This evaluation provides insight into the usability and acceptability of various app features and contains a number of recommendations for improving user satisfaction and the potential effectiveness of apps designed to encourage reductions in alcohol consumption.;,citation_author=Sophie Attwood;,citation_author=Hannah Parke;,citation_author=John Larsen;,citation_author=Katie L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Relapse and Relapse Prevention;,citation_abstract=Abstract Most psychological disorders and problem behaviors are characterized by very high rates of postremittance relapse. Thus, advances in the long-term efficacy of psychological interventions require understanding the causes and processes of relapse, with the ultimate goal of developing strategies that reduce the probability of relapse. Existing psychological theory and interventions relevant to relapse and relapse prevention (RP) are reviewed, with a focus on addictive behaviors. The past two decades have produced increased attention toward the relapse problem and important advances in the conceptualization of relapse (i.e., as a process rather than a discrete event). Further progress will require the translation of basic theory into applied theory, the development of integrative theories of relapse, and the design and testing of theory-based, multimodal RP interventions.;,citation_author=Thomas H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cue dependency of nicotine self-administration and smoking;,citation_abstract=A paradox exists regarding the reinforcing properties of nicotine. The abuse liability associated with smoking equals or exceeds that of other addictive drugs, yet the euphoric, reinforcing and other psychological effects of nicotine, compared to these other drugs, are more subtle, are manifest under more restricted conditions, and do not readily predict the difficulty most smokers experience in achieving abstinence. One possible resolution to this apparent inconsistency is that environmental cues associated with drug delivery become conditioned reinforcers and take on powerful incentive properties that are critically important for sustaining smoking in humans and nicotine self-administration in animals. We tested this hypothesis by using a widely employed self-administration paradigm in which rats press a lever at high rates for 1 h/day to obtain intravenous infusions of nicotine that are paired with two types of visual stimuli: a chamber light that when turned on signals drug availability and a 1-s cue light that signals drug delivery. We show that these visual cues are at least as important as nicotine in sustaining a high rate of responding once self-administration has been established, in the degree to which withdrawing nicotine extinguishes the behavior, and in the reinstatement of lever pressing after extinction. Additional studies demonstrated that the importance of these cues was manifest under both fixed ratio and progressive ratio (PR) schedules of reinforcement. The possibility that nicotine-paired cues are as important as nicotine in smoking behavior should refocus our attention on the psychology and neurobiology of conditioned reinforcers in order to stimulate the development of more effective treatment programs for smoking cessation.;,citation_author=A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Trajectories of Depression: Unobtrusive Monitoring of Depressive States by means of Smartphone Mobility Traces Analysis;,citation_abstract=One of the most interesting applications of mobile sensing is monitoring of individual behavior, especially in the area of mental health care. Most existing systems require an interaction with the device, for example they may require the user to input his/her mood state at regular intervals. In this paper we seek to answer whether mobile phones can be used to unobtrusively monitor individuals affected by depressive mood disorders by analyzing only their mobility patterns from GPS traces. In order to get ground-truth measurements, we have developed a smartphone application that periodically collects the locations of the users and the answers to daily questionnaires that quantify their depressive mood. We demonstrate that there exists a significant correlation between mobility trace characteristics and the depressive moods. Finally, we present the design of models that are able to successfully predict changes in the depressive mood of individuals by analyzing their movements.;,citation_author=L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Realize, Analyze, Engage (RAE): A Digital Tool to Support Recovery from Substance Use Disorder;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Substance use disorders are a highly prevalent group of chronic diseases with devastating individual and public health consequences. Current treatment strategies suffer from high rates of relapse, or return to drug use, and novel solutions are desperately needed. Realize Analyze Engage (RAE) is a digital, mHealth intervention that focusses on real time, objective detection of high-risk events (stress and drug craving) to deploy just-in-time supportive interventions. The present study aims to (1) evaluate the accuracy and usability of the RAE system and (2) evaluate the impact of RAE on patient centered outcomes. METHODS: The first phase of the study will be an observational trial of N = 50 participants in outpatient treatment for SUD using the RAE system for 30 days. Accuracy of craving and stress detection algorithms will be evaluated, and usability of RAE will be explored via semi-structured interviews with participants and focus groups with SUD treatment clinicians. The second phase of the study will be a randomized controlled trial of RAE vs usual care to evaluate rates of return to use, retention in treatment, and quality of life. ANTICIPATED FINDINGS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS: The RAE platform is a potentially powerful tool to de-escalate stress and craving outside of the clinical milieu, and to connect with a support system needed most. RAE also aims to provide clinicians with actionable insight to understand patients’ level of risk, and contextual clues for their triggers in order to provide more personalized recovery support.;,citation_author=Stephanie Carreiro;,citation_author=Melissa Taylor;,citation_author=Sloke Shrestha;,citation_author=Megan Reinhardt;,citation_author=Nicole Gilbertson;,citation_author=Premananda Indic;,citation_publication_date=2021;,citation_cover_date=2021;,citation_year=2021;,citation_doi=10.20900/jpbs.20210002;,citation_issn=2398-385X;,citation_pmid=33748430;,citation_volume=6;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Psychiatry and Brain Science;">

Our novel approach is a feature extraction technique that allows us to select meaningful features indicative of depressive symptoms from longitudinal data. It allows us to detect the presence of post-semester depressive symptoms with an accuracy of 85.7% and change in symptom severity with an accuracy of 85.4%. It also predicts these outcomes with an accuracy of &amp;amp;amp;gt;80%, 11–15 weeks before the end of the semester, allowing ample time for pre-emptive interventions.

This article introduces issues of discrimination to the data science community on its own terms. In it, we tour the familiar data mining process while providing a taxonomy of common practices that have the potential to produce unintended discrimination. We also survey how discrimination is commonly measured, and suggest how familiar development processes can be augmented to mitigate systems’ discriminatory potential. We advocate that data scientists should be intentional about modeling and reducing discriminatory outcomes. Without doing so, their efforts will result in perpetuating any systemic discrimination that may exist, but under a misleading veil of data-driven objectivity.;,citation_author=Brian Alessandro;,citation_author=Cathy O’Neil;,citation_author=Tom LaGatta;,citation_publication_date=2017-06;,citation_cover_date=2017-06;,citation_year=2017;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09013;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1089/big.2016.0048;,citation_issn=2167-6461, 2167-647X;,citation_volume=5;,citation_journal_title=Big Data;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Digital health tools for the passive monitoring of depression: A systematic review of methods;,citation_abstract=Abstract The use of digital tools to measure physiological and behavioural variables of potential relevance to mental health is a growing field sitting at the intersection between computer science, engineering, and clinical science. We summarised the literature on remote measuring technologies, mapping methodological challenges and threats to reproducibility, and identified leading digital signals for depression. Medical and computer science databases were searched between January 2007 and November 2019. Published studies linking depression and objective behavioural data obtained from smartphone and wearable device sensors in adults with unipolar depression and healthy subjects were included. A descriptive approach was taken to synthesise study methodologies. We included 51 studies and found threats to reproducibility and transparency arising from failure to provide comprehensive descriptions of recruitment strategies, sample information, feature construction and the determination and handling of missing data. The literature is characterised by small sample sizes, short follow-up duration and great variability in the quality of reporting, limiting the interpretability of pooled results. Bivariate analyses show consistency in statistically significant associations between depression and digital features from sleep, physical activity, location, and phone use data. Machine learning models found the predictive value of aggregated features. Given the pitfalls in the combined literature, these results should be taken purely as a starting point for hypothesis generation. Since this research is ultimately aimed at informing clinical practice, we recommend improvements in reporting standards including consideration of generalisability and reproducibility, such as wider diversity of samples, thorough reporting methodology and the reporting of potential bias in studies with numerous features.;,citation_author=Valeria De Angel;,citation_author=Serena Lewis;,citation_author=Katie White;,citation_author=Carolin Oetzmann;,citation_author=Daniel Leightley;,citation_author=Emanuela Oprea;,citation_author=Grace Lavelle;,citation_author=Faith Matcham;,citation_author=Alice Pace;,citation_author=David C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Identifying Behavioral Phenotypes of Loneliness and Social Isolation with Passive Sensing: Statistical Analysis, Data Mining and Machine Learning of Smartphone and Fitbit Data;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Feelings of loneliness are associated with poor physical and mental health. Detection of loneliness through passive sensing on personal devices can lead to the development of interventions aimed at decreasing rates of loneliness. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the potential of using passive sensing to infer levels of loneliness and to identify the corresponding behavioral patterns. METHODS: Data were collected from smartphones and Fitbits (Flex 2) of 160 college students over a semester. The participants completed the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) loneliness questionnaire at the beginning and end of the semester. For a classification purpose, the scores were categorized into high (questionnaire score&amp;amp;amp;gt;40) and low (\leq40) levels of loneliness. Daily features were extracted from both devices to capture activity and mobility, communication and phone usage, and sleep behaviors. The features were then averaged to generate semester-level features. We used 3 analytic methods: (1) statistical analysis to provide an overview of loneliness in college students, (2) data mining using the Apriori algorithm to extract behavior patterns associated with loneliness, and (3) machine learning classification to infer the level of loneliness and the change in levels of loneliness using an ensemble of gradient boosting and logistic regression algorithms with feature selection in a leave-one-student-out cross-validation manner. RESULTS: The average loneliness score from the presurveys and postsurveys was above 43 (presurvey SD 9.4 and postsurvey SD 10.4), and the majority of participants fell into the high loneliness category (scores above 40) with 63.8% (102/160) in the presurvey and 58.8% (94/160) in the postsurvey. Scores greater than 1 standard deviation above the mean were observed in 12.5% (20/160) of the participants in both pre- and postsurvey scores. The majority of scores, however, fell between 1 standard deviation below and above the mean (pre=66.9% [107/160] and post=73.1% [117/160]). Our machine learning pipeline achieved an accuracy of 80.2% in detecting the binary level of loneliness and an 88.4% accuracy in detecting change in the loneliness level. The mining of associations between classifier-selected behavioral features and loneliness indicated that compared with students with low loneliness, students with high levels of loneliness were spending less time outside of campus during evening hours on weekends and spending less time in places for social events in the evening on weekdays (support=17% and confidence=92%). The analysis also indicated that more activity and less sedentary behavior, especially in the evening, was associated with a decrease in levels of loneliness from the beginning of the semester to the end of it (support=31% and confidence=92%). CONCLUSIONS: Passive sensing has the potential for detecting loneliness in college students and identifying the associated behavioral patterns. These findings highlight intervention opportunities through mobile technology to reduce the impact of loneliness on individuals’ health and well-being.;,citation_author=Afsaneh Doryab;,citation_author=Daniella K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The accuracy, fairness, and limits of predicting recidivism;,citation_abstract=Should we trust computers to make life-altering decisions in the criminal justice system? , Algorithms for predicting recidivism are commonly used to assess a criminal defendant’s likelihood of committing a crime.

Proponents of these systems argue that big data and advanced machine learning make these analyses more accurate and less biased than humans. We show, however, that the widely used commercial risk assessment software COMPAS is no more accurate or fair than predictions made by people with little or no criminal justice expertise. In addition, despite COMPAS’s collection of 137 features, the same accuracy can be achieved with a simple linear classifier with only two features.;,citation_author=Julia Dressel;,citation_author=Hany Farid;,citation_publication_date=2018-01;,citation_cover_date=2018-01;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1126/sciadv.aao5580;,citation_issn=2375-2548;,citation_volume=4;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Science Advances;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Real-time tracking of neighborhood surroundings and mood in urban drug misusers: Application of a new method to study behavior in its geographical context;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Maladaptive behaviors may be more fully understood and efficiently prevented by ambulatory tools that assess people’s ongoing experience in the context of their environment. METHODS: To demonstrate new field-deployable methods for assessing mood and behavior as a function of neighborhood surroundings (geographical momentary assessment; GMA), we collected time-stamped GPS data and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) ratings of mood, stress, and drug craving over 16 weeks at randomly prompted times during the waking hours of opioid-dependent polydrug users receiving methadone maintenance. Locations of EMA entries and participants’ travel tracks calculated for the 12 before each EMA entry were mapped. Associations between subjective ratings and objective environmental ratings were evaluated at the whole neighborhood and 12-h track levels. RESULTS: Participants (N=27) were compliant with GMA data collection; 3711 randomly prompted EMA entries were matched to specific locations. At the neighborhood level, physical disorder was negatively correlated with negative mood, stress, and heroin and cocaine craving (ps&amp;amp;amp;lt;.0001-.0335); drug activity was negatively correlated with stress, heroin and cocaine craving (ps .0009-.0134). Similar relationships were found for the environments around respondents’ tracks in the 12h preceding EMA entries. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the feasibility of GMA. The relationships between neighborhood characteristics and participants’ reports were counterintuitive and counter-hypothesized, and challenge some assumptions about how ostensibly stressful environments are associated with lived experience and how such environments ultimately impair health. GMA methodology may have applications for development of individual- or neighborhood-level interventions.;,citation_author=David H. Epstein;,citation_author=Matthew Tyburski;,citation_author=Ian M.

SMIs such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are characterized by fluctuating symptoms and sudden relapse. Currently, monitoring of people with an SMI is largely done through face-to-face visits. Smartphone-based geolocation sensors create opportunities for continuous monitoring and early intervention.We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Scopus by combining terms related to geolocation and smartphones with SMI concepts. Study selection and data extraction were done in duplicate.Eighteen publications describing 16 studies were included in our review. Eleven studies focused on bipolar disorder. Common geolocation-derived digital biomarkers were number of locations visited (n = 8), distance traveled (n = 8), time spent at prespecified locations (n = 7), and number of changes in GSM (Global System for Mobile communications) cell (n = 4). Twelve of 14 publications evaluating clinical aspects found an association between geolocation-derived digital biomarker and SMI concepts, especially mood. Geolocation-derived digital biomarkers were more strongly associated with SMI concepts than other information (eg, accelerometer data, smartphone activity, self-reported symptoms). However, small sample sizes and short follow-up warrant cautious interpretation of these findings: of all included studies, 7 had a sample of fewer than 10 patients and 11 had a duration shorter than 12 weeks.The growing body of evidence for the association between SMI concepts and geolocation-derived digital biomarkers shows potential for this instrument to be used for continuous monitoring of patients in their everyday lives, but there is a need for larger studies with longer follow-up times.;,citation_author=Paolo Fraccaro;,citation_author=Anna Beukenhorst;,citation_author=Matthew Sperrin;,citation_author=Simon Harper;,citation_author=Jasper Palmier-Claus;,citation_author=Shôn Lewis;,citation_author=Sabine N Van der Veer;,citation_author=Niels Peek;,citation_publication_date=2019-11;,citation_cover_date=2019-11;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=11;,citation_doi=10.1093/jamia/ocz043;,citation_issn=1527-974X;,citation_volume=26;,citation_journal_title=Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Tracking the When, Where, and With Whom of Alcohol Use: Integrating Ecological Momentary Assessment and Geospatial Data to Examine Risk for Alcohol-Related Problems;,citation_abstract=Prevention researchers have found that drinking in different contexts is related to different alcohol problems. Where and with whom people drink affects the types of alcohol-related problems they experience. Consequently, identifying those contexts that result in the greatest number of problems provides a novel opportunity to target new prevention efforts aimed at those contexts. However, identifying these contexts poses methodological challenges to prevention research. To overcome these challenges, researchers need tools that allow them to gather detailed information about when and where people choose to drink and how contextual factors influence drinking risks. New data collection and analysis techniques, such as activity-space analysis, which examines movement through different contexts, and ecological momentary assessment, which captures microlevel contextual changes as individuals move through their days, can advance the field of alcohol studies by providing detailed information on the use of drinking contexts, particularly when combined. Data acquired through these methods allow researchers to better identify those con-texts where and conditions under which drinking and problems related to drinking occur. Use of these methods will allow prevention practitioners to target prevention efforts to those contexts that place most drinkers at risk and tailor prevention efforts to each context for specific outcomes.;,citation_author=Bridget Freisthler;,citation_author=Sharon Lipperman-Kreda;,citation_author=Melina Bersamin;,citation_author=Paul J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Structural racism in precision medicine: Leaving no one behind;,citation_abstract=Abstract Background Precision medicine (PM) is an emerging approach to individualized care. It aims to help physicians better comprehend and predict the needs of their patients while effectively adopting in a timely manner the most suitable treatment by promoting the sharing of health data and the implementation of learning healthcare systems. Alongside its promises, PM also entails the risk of exacerbating healthcare inequalities, in particular between ethnoracial groups. One often-neglected underlying reason why this might happen is the impact of structural racism on PM initiatives. Raising awareness as to how structural racism can influence PM initiatives is paramount to avoid that PM ends up reproducing the pre-existing health inequalities between different ethnoracial groups and contributing to the loss of trust in healthcare by minority groups. Main body We analyse three nodes of a process flow where structural racism can affect PM’s implementation. These are: (i) the collection of biased health data during the initial encounter of minority groups with the healthcare system and researchers, (ii) the integration of biased health data for minority groups in PM initiatives and (iii) the influence of structural racism on the deliverables of PM initiatives for minority groups. We underscore that underappreciation of structural racism by stakeholders involved in the PM ecosystem can be at odds with the ambition of ensuring social and racial justice. Potential specific actions related to the analysed nodes are then formulated to help ensure that PM truly adheres to the goal of leaving no one behind , as endorsed by member states of the United Nations for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Conclusion Structural racism has been entrenched in our societies for centuries and it would be naïve to believe that its impacts will not spill over in the era of PM. PM initiatives need to pay special attention to the discriminatory and harmful impacts that structural racism could have on minority groups involved in their respective projects. It is only by acknowledging and discussing the existence of implicit racial biases&nbsp;and trust issues in healthcare and research domains that proper interventions to remedy them can be implemented.;,citation_author=Lester Darryl Geneviève;,citation_author=Andrea Martani;,citation_author=David Shaw;,citation_author=Bernice Simone Elger;,citation_author=Tenzin Wangmo;,citation_publication_date=2020-12;,citation_cover_date=2020-12;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1186/s12910-020-0457-8;,citation_issn=1472-6939;,citation_volume=21;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=BMC Medical Ethics;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Gender Differences in Use of Alcohol Treatment Services and Reasons for Nonuse in a National Sample;,citation_abstract=Background The majority of adults with alcohol use disorders do not obtain help, and women are less likely to utilize alcohol services than men. We sought to quantify gender differences in alcohol services utilization, overall and by type, using national longitudinal data and to explore potential gender differences in perceived need for help and reasons for not seeking help. Methods We analyzed data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions from White, African American, and Hispanic adults ( n &nbsp;=&nbsp;2,592) who met DSM-IV criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence at Wave 1 (2000 to 2001). We tested gender differences in Wave 2 (2004 to 2005) services utilization, perceived need for help, and treatment barriers using Rao-Scott chi-square tests and assessed predictors of outcomes in multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for problem severity, co-occurring disorders, and demographics. Results Women had much lower odds than men of utilizing any alcohol service (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.53; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.33, 0.86), specialty services (aOR 0.41; 95% CI 0.19, 0.87), and 12-step groups (aOR 0.39; 95% CI 0.21, 0.71). Perceived need for help among those who had not used any services was very low (5%), with no gender difference. Further, men and women reported equivalent numbers of treatment barriers and the same rank order for the most frequently endorsed barriers. However, women were twice as likely as men to think a problem would get better by itself—the most frequent reason for not seeking help (47% vs. 24%, p &nbsp;&amp;amp;amp;lt;~0.001), and men were more likely than women to report unsuccessful past help-seeking and not thinking anyone could help (19% vs. 3%, p &nbsp;&amp;lt;~0.001 and 17% vs. 5%, p &nbsp;=&nbsp;0.001, respectively). Conclusions Consistent with previous studies, women were less likely to utilize alcohol services than men.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Comparison of a smartphone app for alcohol use disorders with an Internet-based intervention plus bibliotherapy: A pilot study;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE: To date, no research has evaluated the efficacy of a stand-alone, smartphone-based intervention for individuals with an alcohol use disorder. The current pilot study evaluated the short-term outcomes of a smartphone-based intervention for alcohol use disorders compared with an Internet-based brief motivational intervention plus bibliotherapy. METHOD: Adults (18 to 45 years old) with an alcohol use disorder received either the Location-Based Monitoring and Intervention for Alcohol Use Disorders (LBMI-A; n = 28), a smartphone-based intervention, or the online Drinker’s Check-up plus bibliotherapy (DCU + bib; n = 26). These groups were compared using the Timeline Followback interview for percent days abstinent (PDA), percent heavy drinking days (PHDD), and drinks per week (DPW) from baseline to 6 weeks after the introduction of the interventions. RESULTS: Multilevel models revealed that the LBMI-A resulted in a significant increase in PDA over the course of the study, whereas the DCU + bib did not. Effect sizes for change from baseline for PDA suggest that the DCU + bib resulted in moderate a decrease, whereas the LBMI-A resulted in a large increase in PDA. Both interventions resulted in significant decreases in PHDD and DPW. The LBMI-A produced larger reductions in the first 3 to 4 weeks after the intervention was introduced than the DCU + bib. On weeks with greater LBMI-A usage, participants reported less DPW and PHDD. CONCLUSIONS: Both interventions resulted in significant decreases in alcohol use over the 6-week trial, which is promising for stand-alone technology-based intervention systems aimed at individuals with an alcohol use disorder.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=What does ’access to health care’ mean?;,citation_abstract=Facilitating access is concerned with helping people to command appropriate health care resources in order to preserve or improve their health. Access is a complex concept and at least four aspects require evaluation. If services are available and there is an adequate supply of services, then the opportunity to obtain health care exists, and a population may ’have access’ to services. The extent to which a population ’gains access’ also depends on financial, organisational and social or cultural barriers that limit the utilisation of services. Thus access measured in terms of utilisation is dependent on the affordability, physical accessibility and acceptability of services and not merely adequacy of supply. Services available must be relevant and effective if the population is to ’gain access to satisfactory health outcomes’. The availability of services, and barriers to access, have to be considered in the context of the differing perspectives, health needs and material and cultural settings of diverse groups in society. Equity of access may be measured in terms of the availability, utilisation or outcomes of services.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Psychiatric Comorbidity as a Function of Severity: DSM-5 Alcohol Use Disorder and HiTOP Classification of Mental Disorders;,citation_abstract=Background Understanding the comorbidity of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and other psychiatric diagnoses has been a long-standing interest of researchers and mental health professionals. Comorbidity is often examined via the diagnostic co-occurrence of discrete, categorical diagnoses, which is incongruent with increasingly supported dimensional approaches of psychiatric classification and diagnosis, and for AUD more specifically. The present study examined associations between DSM-5 AUD and psychiatric symptoms of other DSM-IV and DSM-5 disorders categorically, and dimensionally organized according to the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) spectra (e.g., Internalizing, Disinhibited Externalizing). Methods The comorbidity of AUD with other psychological disorders was examined in 2 independent nationally representative samples of past-year drinkers via an initial examination in the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) Wave 2 and replicated in NESARC-III. Results Analyses focusing on psychopathology symptom counts organized by spectra demonstrated that greater AUD severity was associated with a higher number of symptoms across HiTOP spectra. Traditional categorical analyses also demonstrated increasing prevalence as a monotonic function of DSM-5 AUD severity gradients. Conclusions This study indicates that AUD and other psychiatric disorder comorbidity implies increased presence of multiple forms of psychopathology with a corresponding increased number of symptoms across hierarchical spectra. Greater AUD severity increases the likelihood of other psychopathology and, when present, “more severe” presentations. That is, on average, a given disorder (e.g., depression) is more severe when copresenting with an AUD, and increases in severity along with the AUD.;,citation_author=Ashley C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Differential Fairness: An Intersectional Framework for Fair AI;,citation_abstract=We propose definitions of fairness in machine learning and artificial intelligence systems that are informed by the framework of intersectionality, a critical lens from the legal, social science, and humanities literature which analyzes how interlocking systems of power and oppression affect individuals along overlapping dimensions including gender, race, sexual orientation, class, and disability. We show that our criteria behave sensibly for any subset of the set of protected attributes, and we prove economic, privacy, and generalization guarantees. Our theoretical results show that our criteria meaningfully operationalize AI fairness in terms of real-world harms, making the measurements interpretable in a manner analogous to differential privacy. We provide a simple learning algorithm using deterministic gradient methods, which respects our intersectional fairness criteria. The measurement of fairness becomes statistically challenging in the minibatch setting due to data sparsity, which increases rapidly in the number of protected attributes and in the values per protected attribute. To address this, we further develop a practical learning algorithm using stochastic gradient methods which incorporates stochastic estimation of the intersectional fairness criteria on minibatches to scale up to big data. Case studies on census data, the COMPAS criminal recidivism dataset, the HHP hospitalization data, and a loan application dataset from HMDA demonstrate the utility of our methods.;,citation_author=Rashidul Islam;,citation_author=Kamrun Naher Keya;,citation_author=Shimei Pan;,citation_author=Anand D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Potent Effect of Environmental Context on Relapse to Alcohol-Seeking After Extinction;,citation_abstract=Environments in which the pharmacological effects of alcohol have been experienced become potent triggers for relapse in abstinent humans. Animal models developed to study the effect of environmental contexts on relapse to alcohol-seeking behavior demonstrate that alcohol-seeking is renewed by exposure to an alcohol-associated context, following the extinction of alcohol-seeking in a different context. Hence, contexts in which alcohol conditioning and extinction learning occur can be critical determinants for whether or not alcohol-seeking behavior is observed. This review summarizes preclinical research to date examining the role of alcohol contexts on the reinstatement of extinguished responding for alcohol. Behavioral studies have elucidated factors that are important for eliciting context-dependent relapse, and have uncovered novel interactions between alcohol-seeking driven by discrete alcohol cues in different contexts. Neuropharmacological studies provide substantial evidence for a role of dopaminergic systems in context-dependent reinstatement, and growing support for opioidergic mechanisms as well.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Considering Drug-Associated Contexts in Substance Use Disorders and Treatment Development;,citation_abstract=Environmental contexts that are reliably associated with the use of pharmacologically active substances are hypothesized to contribute to substance use disorders. In this review, we provide an updated summary of parallel preclinical and human studies that support this hypothesis. Research conducted in rats shows that environmental contexts that are reliably paired with drug use can renew extinguished drug-seeking behavior and amplify responding elicited by discrete, drug-predictive cues. Akin to drug-associated contexts, interoceptive drug stimuli produced by the psychopharmacological effects of drugs can also influence learning and memory processes that play a role in substance use disorders. Findings from human laboratory studies show that drug-associated contexts, including social stimuli, can have profound effects on cue reactivity, drug use, and drug-related cognitive expectancies. This translationally relevant research supports the idea that treatments for substance use disorders could be improved by considering drug-associated contexts as a factor in treatment interventions. We conclude this review with ideas for how to integrate drug-associated contexts into treatment-oriented research based on 4 approaches: pharmacology, brain stimulation, mindfulness-based relapse prevention, and cognitive behavioral group therapy.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A unified approach to interpreting model predictions;,citation_abstract=Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction’s accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.;,citation_author=Scott M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Treating alcoholism as a chronic disease: Approaches to long-term continuing care;,citation_abstract=For many patients, alcohol and other drug (AOD) use disorders are chronic, recurring conditions involving multiple cycles of treatment, abstinence, and relapse. To disrupt this cycle, treatment can include continuing care to reduce the risk of relapse. The most commonly used treatment approach is initial intensive inpatient or outpatient care based on 12-step principles, followed by continuing care involving self-help groups, 12-step group counseling, or individual therapy. Although these programs can be effective, many patients drop out of initial treatment or do not complete continuing care. Thus, researchers and clinicians have begun to develop alternative approaches to enhance treatment retention in both initial and continuing care. One focus of these efforts has been the design of extended treatment models. These approaches increasingly blur the distinction between initial and continuing care and aim to prolong treatment participation by providing a continuum of care. Other researchers have focused on developing alternative treatment strategies (e.g., telephone-based interventions) that go beyond traditional settings and adaptive treatment algorithms that may improve outcomes for clients who do not respond well to traditional approaches.;,citation_author=James R.

A major factor that obstructs the attainment of abstinence is the persistence of maladaptive drug-associated memories, which can maintain drug-seeking and taking behaviour and promote unconscious relapse of these habits. Thus, addiction can be conceptualised as a disorder of aberrant learning of the formation of strong instrumental memories linking actions to drug-seeking and taking outcomes that ultimately are expressed as persistent stimulus-response habits; of previously neutral environmental stimuli that become associated with drug highs (and/or withdrawal states) through pavlovian conditioning, and of the subsequent interactions between pavlovian and instrumental memories to influence relapse behaviour. Understanding the psychological, neurobiological and molecular basis of these drug memories may produce new methods of pro-abstinence, anti-relapse treatments for addiction.;,citation_author=Amy L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Rates and predictors of relapse after natural and treated remission from alcohol use disorders;,citation_abstract=AIMS: This study examined the rates and predictors of 3-year remission, and subsequent 16-year relapse, among initially untreated individuals with alcohol use disorders who did not obtain help or who participated in treatment and/or Alcoholics Anonymous in the first year after recognizing their need for help. DESIGN AND MEASURES: A sample of individuals (n = 461) who initiated help-seeking was surveyed at baseline and 1 year, 3 years, 8 years and 16 years later. Participants provided information on their life history of drinking, alcohol-related functioning and life context and coping. FINDINGS: Compared to individuals who obtained help, those who did not were less likely to achieve 3-year remission and subsequently were more likely to relapse. Less alcohol consumption and fewer drinking problems, more self-efficacy and less reliance on avoidance coping at baseline predicted 3-year remission; this was especially true of individuals who remitted without help. Among individuals who were remitted at 3 years, those who consumed more alcohol but were less likely to see their drinking as a significant problem, had less self-efficacy, and relied more on avoidance coping, were more likely to relapse by 16 years. These findings held for individuals who initially obtained help and for those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: Natural remission may be followed by a high likelihood of relapse; thus, preventive interventions may be indicated to forestall future alcohol problems among individuals who cut down temporarily on drinking on their own.;,citation_author=Rudolf H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Depression predictions from GPS-based mobility do not generalize well to large demographically heterogeneous samples;,citation_abstract=Depression is one of the most common mental health issues in the United States, affecting the lives of millions of people suffering from it as well as those close to them. Recent advances in research on mobile sensing technologies and machine learning have suggested that a person’s depression can be passively measured by observing patterns in people’s mobility behaviors. However, the majority of work in this area has relied on highly homogeneous samples, most frequently college students. In this study, we analyse over 57 million GPS data points to show that the same procedure that leads to high prediction accuracy in a homogeneous student sample (N = 57; AUC = 0.82), leads to accuracies only slightly higher than chance in a U.S.-wide sample that is heterogeneous in its socio-demographic composition as well as mobility patterns (N = 5,262; AUC = 0.57). This pattern holds across three different modelling approaches which consider both linear and non-linear relationships. Further analyses suggest that the prediction accuracy is low across different socio-demographic groups, and that training the models on more homogeneous subsamples does not substantially improve prediction accuracy.

Such mobility behaviours likely influence and are influenced by people’s subjective well–being. However, past research examining the links between mobility behaviours and well–being has been inconclusive. Here, we provide a comprehensive investigation of these relationships by examining individual differences in two types of mobility behaviours (movement patterns and places visited) and their relationship to six indicators of subjective well–being (depression, loneliness, anxiety, stress, affect, and energy) at two different temporal levels of analysis (two–week tendencies and daily level). Using data from a large smartphone–based longitudinal study (N = 1765), we show that (i) movement patterns assessed via GPS data (distance travelled, entropy, and irregularity) and (ii) places visited assessed via experience sampling reports (home, work, and social places) are associated with subjective well–being at the between and within person levels. Our findings suggest that distance travelled is related to anxiety, affect, and stress, irregularity is related to depression and loneliness, and spending time in social places is negatively associated with loneliness.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Predicting Depression in Adolescents Using Mobile and Wearable Sensors: Multimodal Machine Learning–Based Exploratory Study;,citation_abstract=Background Depression levels in adolescents have trended upward over the past several years. According to a 2020 survey by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 4.1 million US adolescents have experienced at least one major depressive episode. This number constitutes approximately 16% of adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. However, only 32.3% of adolescents received some form of specialized or nonspecialized treatment. Identifying worsening symptoms earlier using mobile and wearable sensors may lead to earlier intervention. Most studies on predicting depression using sensor-based data are geared toward the adult population. Very few studies look into predicting depression in adolescents. Objective The aim of our work was to study passively sensed data from adolescents with depression and investigate the predictive capabilities of 2 machine learning approaches to predict depression scores and change in depression levels in adolescents. This work also provided an in-depth analysis of sensor features that serve as key indicators of change in depressive symptoms and the effect of variation of data samples on model accuracy levels. Methods This study included 55 adolescents with symptoms of depression aged 12 to 17 years. Each participant was passively monitored through smartphone sensors and Fitbit wearable devices for 24 weeks. Passive sensors collected call, conversation, location, and heart rate information daily. Following data preprocessing, 67% (37/55) of the participants in the aggregated data set were analyzed. Weekly Patient Health Questionnaire-9 surveys answered by participants served as the ground truth. We applied regression-based approaches to predict the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 depression score and change in depression severity. These approaches were consolidated using universal and personalized modeling strategies. The universal strategies consisted of Leave One Participant Out and Leave Week X Out. The personalized strategy models were based on Accumulated Weeks and Leave One Week One User Instance Out. Linear and nonlinear machine learning algorithms were trained to model the data. Results We observed that personalized approaches performed better on adolescent depression prediction compared with universal approaches. The best models were able to predict depression score and weekly change in depression level with root mean squared errors of 2.83 and 3.21, respectively, following the Accumulated Weeks personalized modeling strategy. Our feature importance investigation showed that the contribution of screen-, call-, and location-based features influenced optimal models and were predictive of adolescent depression. Conclusions This study provides insight into the feasibility of using passively sensed data for predicting adolescent depression. We demonstrated prediction capabilities in terms of depression score and change in depression level. The prediction results revealed that personalized models performed better on adolescents than universal approaches. Feature importance provided a better understanding of depression and sensor data.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Context-Sensing Mobile Phone App (Q Sense) for Smoking Cessation: A Mixed-Methods Study;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: A major cause of lapse and relapse to smoking during a quit attempt is craving triggered by cues from a smoker’s immediate environment. To help smokers address these cue-induced cravings when attempting to quit, we have developed a context-aware smoking cessation app, Q Sense, which uses a smoking episode-reporting system combined with location sensing and geofencing to tailor support content and trigger support delivery in real time. OBJECTIVE: We sought to (1) assess smokers’ compliance with reporting their smoking in real time and identify reasons for noncompliance, (2) assess the app’s accuracy in identifying user-specific high-risk locations for smoking, (3) explore the feasibility and user perspective of geofence-triggered support, and (4) identify any technological issues or privacy concerns. METHODS: An explanatory sequential mixed-methods design was used, where data collected by the app informed semistructured interviews. Participants were smokers who owned an Android mobile phone and were willing to set a quit date within one month (N=15). App data included smoking reports with context information and geolocation, end-of-day (EoD) surveys of smoking beliefs and behavior, support message ratings, and app interaction data. Interviews were undertaken and analyzed thematically (N=13). Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed separately and findings presented sequentially. RESULTS: Out of 15 participants, 3 (20%) discontinued use of the app prematurely. Pre-quit date, the mean number of smoking reports received was 37.8 (SD 21.2) per participant, or 2.0 (SD 2.2) per day per participant. EoD surveys indicated that participants underreported smoking on at least 56.2% of days. Geolocation was collected in 97.0% of smoking reports with a mean accuracy of 31.6 (SD 16.8) meters. A total of 5 out of 9 (56%) eligible participants received geofence-triggered support. Interaction data indicated that 50.0% (137/274) of geofence-triggered message notifications were tapped within 30 minutes of being generated, resulting in delivery of a support message, and 78.2% (158/202) of delivered messages were rated by participants. Qualitative findings identified multiple reasons for noncompliance in reporting smoking, most notably due to environmental constraints and forgetting. Participants verified the app’s identification of their smoking locations, were largely positive about the value of geofence-triggered support, and had no privacy concerns about the data collected by the app. CONCLUSIONS: User-initiated self-report is feasible for training a cessation app about an individual’s smoking behavior, although underreporting is likely. Geofencing was a reliable and accurate method of identifying smoking locations, and geofence-triggered support was regarded positively by participants.;,citation_author=Felix Naughton;,citation_author=Sarah Hopewell;,citation_author=Neal Lathia;,citation_author=Rik Schalbroeck;,citation_author=Chloë Brown;,citation_author=Cecilia Mascolo;,citation_author=Andy McEwen;,citation_author=Stephen Sutton;,citation_publication_date=2016-09;,citation_cover_date=2016-09;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.2196/mhealth.5787;,citation_issn=2291-5222;,citation_pmid=27637405;,citation_volume=4;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=JMIR mHealth and uHealth;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mood ratings and digital biomarkers from smartphone and wearable data differentiates and predicts depression status: A longitudinal data analysis;,citation_abstract=Depression is a prevalent mental disorder. Current clinical and self-reported assessment methods of depression are laborious and incur recall bias. Their sporadic nature often misses severity fluctuations. Previous research highlights the potential of in-situ quantification of human behaviour using mobile sensors to augment traditional methods of depression management. In this paper, we study whether self-reported mood scores and passive smartphone and wearable sensor data could be used to classify people as depressed or non-depressed. In a longitudinal study, our participants provided daily mood (valence and arousal) scores and collected data using their smartphones and Oura Rings. We computed daily aggregations of mood, sleep, physical activity, phone usage, and GPS mobility from raw data to study the differences between the depressed and non-depressed groups and created population-level Machine Learning classification models of depression. We found statistically significant differences in GPS mobility, phone usage, sleep, physical activity and mood between depressed and non-depressed groups. An XGBoost model with daily aggregations of mood and sensor data as predictors classified participants with an accuracy of 81.43% and an Area Under the Curve of 82.31%. A Support Vector Machine using only sensor-based predictors had an accuracy of 77.06% and an Area Under the Curve of 74.25%. Our results suggest that digital biomarkers are promising in differentiating people with and without depression symptoms.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Detecting Bipolar Depression From Geographic Location Data;,citation_abstract=Objective: This paper aims to identify periods of depression using geolocation movements recorded from mobile phones in a prospective community study of individuals with bipolar disorder (BD). Methods: Anonymized geographic location recordings from 22 BD participants and 14 healthy controls (HC) were collected over 3 months. Participants reported their depressive symptomatology using a weekly questionnaire (QIDS-SR16). Recorded location data were preprocessed by detecting and removing imprecise data points and features were extracted to assess the level and regularity of geographic movements of the participant. A subset of features were selected using a wrapper feature selection method and presented to 1) a linear regression model and a quadratic generalized linear model with a logistic link function for questionnaire score estimation; and 2) a quadratic discriminant analysis classifier for depression detection in BD participants based on their questionnaire responses. Results: HC participants did not report depressive symptoms and their features showed similar distributions to nondepressed BD participants. Questionnaire score estimation using geolocation-derived features from BD participants demonstrated an optimal mean absolute error rate of 3.73, while depression detection demonstrated an optimal (median  IQR) F1 score of 0.857  0.022 using five features (classification accuracy: 0.849  0.016; sensitivity: 0.839  0.014; specificity: 0.872  0.047). Conclusion: These results demonstrate a strong link between geographic movements and depression in bipolar disorder. Significance: To our knowledge, this is the first community study of passively recorded objective markers of depression in bipolar disorder of this scale.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Fairness in Mobile Phone–Based Mental Health Assessment Algorithms: Exploratory Study;,citation_abstract=Background Approximately 1 in 5 American adults experience mental illness every year. Thus, mobile phone–based mental health prediction apps that use phone data and artificial intelligence techniques for mental health assessment have become increasingly important and are being rapidly developed. At the same time, multiple artificial intelligence–related technologies (eg, face recognition and search results) have recently been reported to be biased regarding age, gender, and race. This study moves this discussion to a new domain: phone-based mental health assessment algorithms. It is important to ensure that such algorithms do not contribute to gender disparities through biased predictions across gender groups. Objective This research aimed to analyze the susceptibility of multiple commonly used machine learning approaches for gender bias in mobile mental health assessment and explore the use of an algorithmic disparate impact remover (DIR) approach to reduce bias levels while maintaining high accuracy. Methods First, we performed preprocessing and model training using the data set (N=55) obtained from a previous study. Accuracy levels and differences in accuracy across genders were computed using 5 different machine learning models. We selected the random forest model, which yielded the highest accuracy, for a more detailed audit and computed multiple metrics that are commonly used for fairness in the machine learning literature. Finally, we applied the DIR approach to reduce bias in the mental health assessment algorithm. Results The highest observed accuracy for the mental health assessment was 78.57%. Although this accuracy level raises optimism, the audit based on gender revealed that the performance of the algorithm was statistically significantly different between the male and female groups (eg, difference in accuracy across genders was 15.85%; P&amp;amp;amp;lt;.001). Similar trends were obtained for other fairness metrics. This disparity in performance was found to reduce significantly after the application of the DIR approach by adapting the data used for modeling (eg, the difference in accuracy across genders was 1.66%, and the reduction is statistically significant with P&amp;lt;.001). Conclusions This study grounds the need for algorithmic auditing in phone-based mental health assessment algorithms and the use of gender as a protected attribute to study fairness in such settings. Such audits and remedial steps are the building blocks for the widespread adoption of fair and accurate mental health assessment algorithms in the future.;,citation_author=Jinkyung Park;,citation_author=Ramanathan Arunachalam;,citation_author=Vincent Silenzio;,citation_author=Vivek K Singh;,citation_publication_date=2022-06;,citation_cover_date=2022-06;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.2196/34366;,citation_issn=2561-326X;,citation_volume=6;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=JMIR Formative Research;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Defining equity in health;,citation_abstract=Study objective: To propose a definition of health equity to guide operationalisation and measurement, and to discuss the practical importance of clarity in defining this concept. Design: Conceptual discussion. Setting, Patients/Participants, and Main results: not applicable. Conclusions: For the purposes of measurement and operationalisation, equity in health is the absence of systematic disparities in health (or in the major social determinants of health) between groups with different levels of underlying social advantage/disadvantage—that is, wealth, power, or prestige. Inequities in health systematically put groups of people who are already socially disadvantaged (for example, by virtue of being poor, female, and/or members of a disenfranchised racial, ethnic, or religious group) at further disadvantage with respect to their health; health is essential to wellbeing and to overcoming other effects of social disadvantage. Equity is an ethical principle; it also is consonant with and closely related to human rights principles. The proposed definition of equity supports operationalisation of the right to the highest attainable standard of health as indicated by the health status of the most socially advantaged group. Assessing health equity requires comparing health and its social determinants between more and less advantaged social groups. These comparisons are essential to assess whether national and international policies are leading toward or away from greater social justice in health.;,citation_author=P Braveman;,citation_author=S Gruskin;,citation_publication_date=2003-04;,citation_cover_date=2003-04;,citation_year=2003;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1136/jech.57.4.254;,citation_volume=57;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Ensuring Fairness in Machine Learning to Advance Health Equity;,citation_abstract=Machine learning is used increasingly in clinical care to improve diagnosis, treatment selection, and health system efficiency. Because machine-learning models learn from historically collected data, populations that have experienced human and structural biases in the past-called protected groups-are vulnerable to harm by incorrect predictions or withholding of resources. This article describes how model design, biases in data, and the interactions of model predictions with clinicians and patients may exacerbate health care disparities. Rather than simply guarding against these harms passively, machine-learning systems should be used proactively to advance health equity. For that goal to be achieved, principles of distributive justice must be incorporated into model design, deployment, and evaluation. The article describes several technical implementations of distributive justice-specifically those that ensure equality in patient outcomes, performance, and resource allocation-and guides clinicians as to when they should prioritize each principle. Machine learning is providing increasingly sophisticated decision support and population-level monitoring, and it should encode principles of justice to ensure that models benefit all patients.;,citation_author=Alvin Rajkomar;,citation_author=Michaela Hardt;,citation_author=Michael D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Geolocation as a Digital Phenotyping Measure of Negative Symptoms and Functional Outcome;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE: Negative symptoms and functional outcome have traditionally been assessed using clinical rating scales, which rely on retrospective self-reports and have several inherent limitations that impact validity. These issues may be addressed with more objective digital phenotyping measures. In the current study, we evaluated the psychometric properties of a novel &amp;amp;amp;quot;passive&amp;quot; digital phenotyping method: geolocation. METHOD: Participants included outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (SZ: n = 44), outpatients with bipolar disorder (BD: n =19), and demographically matched healthy controls (CN: n = 42) who completed 6 days of &quot;active&quot; digital phenotyping assessments (eg, surveys) while geolocation was recorded. RESULTS: Results indicated that SZ patients show less activity than CN and BD, particularly, in their travel from home. Geolocation variables demonstrated convergent validity by small to medium correlations with negative symptoms and functional outcome measured via clinical rating scales, as well as active digital phenotyping behavioral indices of avolition, asociality, and anhedonia. Discriminant validity was supported by low correlations with positive symptoms, depression, and anxiety. Reliability was supported by good internal consistency and moderate stability across days. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide preliminary support for the reliability and validity of geolocation as an objective measure of negative symptoms and functional outcome. Geolocation offers enhanced precision and the ability to take a &quot;big data&quot; approach that facilitates sophisticated computational models. Near-continuous recordings and large numbers of samples may make geolocation a novel outcome measure for clinical trials due to enhanced power to detect treatment effects.;,citation_author=Ian M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mobile Phone Sensor Correlates of Depressive Symptom Severity in Daily-Life Behavior: An Exploratory Study;,citation_abstract=Background: Depression is a common, burdensome, often recurring mental health disorder that frequently goes undetected and untreated. Mobile phones are ubiquitous and have an increasingly large complement of sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring behavioral patterns that might be indicative of depressive symptoms. Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the detection of daily-life behavioral markers using mobile phone global positioning systems (GPS) and usage sensors, and their use in identifying depressive symptom severity. Methods: A total of 40 adult participants were recruited from the general community to carry a mobile phone with a sensor data acquisition app (Purple Robot) for 2 weeks. Of these participants, 28 had sufficient sensor data received to conduct analysis. At the beginning of the 2-week period, participants completed a self-reported depression survey (PHQ-9). Behavioral features were developed and extracted from GPS location and phone usage data. Results: A number of features from GPS data were related to depressive symptom severity, including circadian movement (regularity in 24-hour rhythm; r=-.63, P=.005), normalized entropy (mobility between favorite locations; r=-.58, P=.012), and location variance (GPS mobility independent of location; r=-.58, P=.012). Phone usage features, usage duration, and usage frequency were also correlated (r=.54, P=.011, and r=.52, P=.015, respectively). Using the normalized entropy feature and a classifier that distinguished participants with depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score &amp;amp;amp;#8805;5) from those without (PHQ-9 score &amp;#60;5), we achieved an accuracy of 86.5%. Furthermore, a regression model that used the same feature to estimate the participants&amp;#8217; PHQ-9 scores obtained an average error of 23.5%. Conclusions: Features extracted from mobile phone sensor data, including GPS and phone usage, provided behavioral markers that were strongly related to depressive symptom severity. While these findings must be replicated in a larger study among participants with confirmed clinical symptoms, they suggest that phone sensors offer numerous clinical opportunities, including continuous monitoring of at-risk populations with little patient burden and interventions that can provide just-in-time outreach.;,citation_author=Sohrab Saeb;,citation_author=Mi Zhang;,citation_author=Christopher J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The relationship between clinical, momentary, and sensor-based assessment of depression;,citation_abstract=The clinical assessment of severity of depressive symptoms is commonly performed with standardized self-report questionnaires, most notably the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9), which are usually administered in a clinic. These questionnaires evaluate symptoms that are stable over time. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods, on the other hand, acquire patient ratings of symptoms in the context of their lives. Today’s smartphones allow us to also obtain objective contextual information, such as the GPS location, that may also be related to depression. Considering clinical PHQ-9 scores as ground truth, an interesting question is to what extent the EMA ratings and contextual sensor data can be used as potential predictors of depression. To answer this question, we obtained PHQ-9 scores from 18 participants with a variety of depressive symptoms in our lab, and then collected their EMA and GPS sensor data using their smartphones over a period of two weeks. We analyzed the relationship between GPS sensor features, EMA ratings, and the PHQ-9 scores. While we found a strong correlation between a number of sensor features extracted from the two-week period and the PHQ-9 scores, the other relationships remained non-significant.

Using geolocation tracking to quantify exploration—variability in daily movement patterns—over a 3-month period in 58 adolescents and adults (ages 13–27) in New York City, we investigated whether daily exploration varied with age and whether exploration related to social connectivity, risk taking, and momentary positive affect. In our cross-sectional sample, we found an association between daily exploration and age, with individuals near the transition to legal adulthood exhibiting the highest exploration levels. Days of higher exploration were associated with greater positive affect irrespective of age. Higher mean exploration was associated with greater social connectivity in all participants but was linked to higher risk taking selectively among adolescents.

The FDA currently has approved 3 pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder: acamprosate, naltrexone, and disulfiram. Previous research suggests that there may exist differences in the prevalence of and outcomes related to AUD across sex and racial/ethnic groups. Other work indicates that there may be differences in the efficacy of existing pharmacological treatments for AUD across demographic groups. The purpose of the present study was to examine the inclusion of women and members of minoritized racial/ethnic groups in published randomized clinical trials of pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder since 1994, in accordance with the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993. PubMed was systematically searched using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The initial search located 842 articles. After exclusion of ineligible articles, 102 remained for analysis. Of those included in the review, only 11.8% reported full sex and racial/ethnic characteristics of their study participants. Of the total sample, 6 articles were specifically examining 1 racial/ethnic group, and 11 were specifically examining 1 sex. Two articles (2.2%) did not report information regarding the sex breakdown of their participants, while 47 (49.0%) did not report any information regarding the racial/ethnic breakdown of their sample. Despite guidelines set forth by NIH, only 5.9% of articles conducted subgroup analyses to examine differences in treatment outcomes by sex or race/ethnicity, and only 16.7% of articles included considerations related to cultural inclusion when discussing study limitations. These results varied by medication type.

Multilevel analysis revealed high outlet density associated with segregated counties and predominantly black census tracts in counties with restrictive alcohol policy. This inverse association between policies designed to limit alcohol availability and overconcentration of outlets in black neighborhoods warrants consideration by policymakers given links between outlet density and health inequities. Consideration of these findings in historical context suggests these policies may function as a contemporary actualization of the historical use of alcohol policy to subjugate black people in the South, now over-concentrating instead of prohibiting access.;,citation_author=Jennifer Scott;,citation_author=Denise Danos;,citation_author=Robert Collins;,citation_author=Neal Simonsen;,citation_author=Claudia Leonardi;,citation_author=Richard Scribner;,citation_author=Denise Herd;,citation_publication_date=2020-07;,citation_cover_date=2020-07;,citation_year=2020;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.healthplace.2020.102385;,citation_issn=1873-2054;,citation_pmid=32755812;,citation_volume=64;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Health &amp;amp;amp; Place;">

Location data demonstrated promising predictive power for depression. Studies examining the relationship between individual location data variables and depression, homestay, entropy, and the normalized entropy variable of entropy dimension showed the most consistent and significant correlations. Furthermore, variables of distance, irregularity, and location showed significant associations in some studies. However, semantic location showed inconsistent results.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Variety in Alcohol Use Disorder Relapse Definitions: Should the Term “Relapse” Be Abandoned?;,citation_abstract=Objective: The definition of relapse has been the subject of debate for decades, and a semantic ambiguity highlighted in a 2016 article in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs remains. The current article replicates and extends the 2016 findings on alcohol use disorder (AUD) relapse definitions. Method: We conducted a systematic review of 321 articles that examined relapse in patients with AUD, published from 2000 to 2019. Relapse definitions were extracted and a narrative review of definitions was conducted. Results: One hundred and one different definitions of relapse were used in 251 (78%) of the reviewed articles. In 70 (22%) of articles, no definition of AUD relapse was provided. Fifty-three articles used diagnostic criteria (i.e., alcohol use after remission of AUD), whereas 99 articles defined relapse as “any alcohol use” or “any use of alcohol/drugs.” Additional articles defined relapse by alcohol outcomes (e.g., percent drinking days), alcohol-related problems, or hospitalizations (n = 97). Only 12 articles described the time window of abstinence preceding a relapse. We observed relatively no meaningful intercontinental or time-related differences in relapse definitions, although the outcome “percent heavy drinking days” was used more frequently in recent studies. Conclusions: A wide variety of relapse definitions were identified. Despite decades of research and discussion, there is still no widely accepted consensus definition of AUD relapse.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Review. Psychological and neural mechanisms of relapse;,citation_abstract=Relapse, the resumption of drug taking after periods of abstinence, remains the major problem for the treatment of addiction. Even when drugs are unavailable for long periods or when users are successful in curbing their drug use for extended periods, individuals remain vulnerable to events that precipitate relapse. Behavioural studies in humans and laboratory animals show that drug-related stimuli, drugs themselves and stressors are powerful events for the precipitation of relapse. Molecular, neurochemical and anatomical studies have identified lasting neural changes that arise from mere exposure to drugs and other enduring changes that arise from learning about the relationship between drug-related stimuli and drug effects. Chronic drug exposure increases sensitivity of some systems of the brain to the effects of drugs and stressful events. These changes, combined with those underlying conditioning and learning, perpetuate vulnerability to drug-related stimuli. Circuits of the brain involved are those of the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system and its glutamatergic connections, and the corticotropin-releasing factor and noradrenergic systems of the limbic brain. This paper reviews advances in our understanding of how these systems mediate the effects of events that precipitate relapse and of how lasting changes in these systems can perpetuate vulnerability to relapse.;,citation_author=Jane Stewart;,citation_publication_date=2008-10;,citation_cover_date=2008-10;,citation_year=2008;,citation_issue=1507;,citation_doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0084;,citation_issn=1471-2970;,citation_pmid=18640921;,citation_volume=363;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Researchers have proposed various human activity recognition (HAR) systems aimed at translating measurements from smartphones into various types of physical activity. In this review, we summarized the existing approaches to smartphone-based HAR. For this purpose, we systematically searched Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science for peer-reviewed articles published up to December 2020 on the use of smartphones for HAR. We extracted information on smartphone body location, sensors, and physical activity types studied and the data transformation techniques and classification schemes used for activity recognition. Consequently, we identified 108 articles and described the various approaches used for data acquisition, data preprocessing, feature extraction, and activity classification, identifying the most common practices, and their alternatives. We conclude that smartphones are well-suited for HAR research in the health sciences. For population-level impact, future studies should focus on improving the quality of collected data, address missing data, incorporate more diverse participants and activities, relax requirements about phone placement, provide more complete documentation on study participants, and share the source code of the implemented methods and algorithms.;,citation_author=Marcin Straczkiewicz;,citation_author=Peter James;,citation_author=Jukka-Pekka Onnela;,citation_publication_date=2021-10;,citation_cover_date=2021-10;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1038/s41746-021-00514-4;,citation_issn=2398-6352;,citation_volume=4;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=npj Digital Medicine;">

This review provides an overview of recent research on the prevalence and patterns of alcohol-related improvement and selectively reviews nationally representative surveys and studies that followed risk groups longitudinally with a goal of informing patients with AUD and AUD researchers, clinicians, and policy-makers about patterns of improvement in the population. Based on the research, alcohol use increases during adolescence and early adulthood and then decreases beginning in the mid-20s across the adult life span. Approximately 70% of persons with AUD and alcohol problems improve without interventions (natural recovery), and fewer than 25% utilize alcohol-focused services. Low-risk drinking is a more common outcome in untreated samples, in part because seeking treatment is associated with higher problem severity. Sex differences are more apparent in help-seeking than recovery patterns, and women have lower help-seeking rates than men. Whites are proportionately more likely to utilize services than are Blacks and Hispanics. Improving recovery rates will likely require offering interventions outside of the health care sector to affected communities and utilizing social networks and public health tools to close the longstanding gap between need and utilization of AUD-focused services.;,citation_author=Jalie A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Drinking, Alcohol Use Disorder, and Treatment Access and Utilization Among U.S. Racial/Ethnic Groups;,citation_abstract=Data from approximately 140 articles and reports published since 2000 on drinking, alcohol use disorder ( AUD ), correlates of drinking and AUD , and treatment needs, access, and utilization were critically examined and summarized. Epidemiological evidence demonstrates alcohol-related disparities across U.S. racial/ethnic groups. American Indians/Alaska Natives generally drink more and are disproportionately affected by alcohol problems, having some of the highest rates for AUD . In contrast, Asian Americans are less affected. Differences across Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics are more nuanced. The diversity in drinking and problem rates that is observed across groups also exists within groups, particularly among Hispanics, Asian Americans, and American Indians/Alaska Natives. Research findings also suggest that acculturation to the United States and nativity affect drinking. Recent studies on ethnic drinking cultures uncover the possible influence that native countries’ cultural norms around consumption still have on immigrants’ alcohol use. The reasons for racial/ethnic disparities in drinking and AUD are complex and are associated with historically rooted patterns of racial discrimination and persistent socioeconomic disadvantage. This disadvantage is present at both individual and environmental levels. Finally, these data indicate that admission to alcohol treatment is also complex and is dependent on the presence and severity of alcohol problems but also on a variety of other factors. These include individuals’ sociodemographic characteristics, the availability of appropriate services, factors that may trigger coercion into treatment by family, friends, employers, and the legal system, and the overall organization of the treatment system. More research is needed to understand facilitators and barriers to treatment to improve access to services and support.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The role of daily mobility in mental health inequalities: The interactive influence of activity space and neighbourhood of residence on depression;,citation_abstract=The literature reports an association between neighbourhood deprivation and individual depression after adjustment for individual factors. The present paper investigates whether vulnerability to neighbourhood features is influenced by individual &amp;amp;amp;quot;activity space&amp;quot; (i.e., the space within which people move about or travel in the course of their daily activities). It can be assumed that a deprived residential environment can exert a stronger influence on the mental health of people whose activity space is limited to their neighbourhood of residence, since their exposure to their neighbourhood would be greater. Moreover, we studied the relationship between activity space size and depression. A limited activity space could indeed reflect spatial and social confinement and thus be associated with a higher risk of being depressed, or, conversely, it could be linked to a deep attachment to the neighbourhood of residence and thus be associated with a lower risk of being depressed. Multilevel logistic regression analyses of a representative sample consisting of 3011 inhabitants surveyed in 2005 in the Paris, France metropolitan area and nested within 50 census blocks showed, after adjusting for individual-level variables, that people living in deprived neighbourhoods were significantly more depressed that those living in more advantaged neighbourhoods. We also observed a statistically significant cross-level interaction between activity space and neighbourhood deprivation, as they relate to depression. Living in a deprived neighbourhood had a stronger and statistically significant effect on depression in people whose activity space was limited to their neighbourhood than in those whose daily travels extended beyond it. In addition, a limited activity space appeared to be a protective factor with regard to depression for people living in advantaged neighbourhoods and a risk factor for those living in deprived neighbourhoods. It could therefore be useful to take activity space into consideration more often when studying the social and spatial determinants of depression.;,citation_author=Julie Vallée;,citation_author=Emmanuelle Cadot;,citation_author=Christelle Roustit;,citation_author=Isabelle Parizot;,citation_author=Pierre Chauvin;,citation_publication_date=2011-10;,citation_cover_date=2011-10;,citation_year=2011;,citation_issue=8;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.08.009;,citation_issn=1873-5347;,citation_pmid=21903318;,citation_volume=73;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Social Science &amp;amp; Medicine (1982);">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol-seeking and relapse: A focus on incentive salience and contextual conditioning;,citation_abstract=Environmental stimuli that reliably accompany alcohol intake can become associated with the pharmacological effects of alcohol through classical (Pavlovian) conditioning. Of growing interest to addiction researchers is whether or not this process results in the attribution of incentive salience to alcohol-predictive cues, which could motivate alcohol-seeking behavior and relapse. To evaluate this question, we present a review of rodent behavioral studies that examined the capacity of alcohol-predictive cues to (i) support sign-tracking behavior, (ii) serve as conditioned reinforcers, and (iii) produce Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer. A second, emerging area of research is focused on delineating the role of context in alcohol-seeking behavior and relapse. Here, we review studies showing that alcohol-associated contexts (i) support conditioned place preference, (ii) renew extinguished alcohol-seeking behavior, and (iii) modulate alcohol-seeking responses elicited by discrete alcohol-predictive cues. These behavioral effects may be mediated by unique psychological processes, and have important implications for cue-reactivity studies and neurobiological research.;,citation_author=Milan D.

Individual factors (coping, self-efficacy, resource needs, and expectations for sober fun), social/environmental factors (craving, exposure, negative social influences, and involvement in substance-using leisure activities), and background characteristics measured during treatment were used to predict alcohol and drug use during a 2-year follow-up using manifest variable regression analysis. Results suggest that poorer self-efficacy, greater involvement in substance-using leisure activities, being single, and less income predicted alcohol use directly, whereas greater resource needs and involvement in substance-using leisure activities, being of minority status, and being single predicted drug use directly. Income, gender, problem severity, marital status, and race also predicted alcohol and drug use indirectly.

Ninety-six substance users provided data regarding their perceived risk for relapse, exposure to substances, and involvement in reinforcing activities.

When controlling for confounding variables, aspects of the home settings significantly distinguished abstainers from reusers; perceived risk for relapse was the strongest predictor of reuse. Exposure to substances and involvement in reinforcing activities were not robust reuse indicators. The work and community settings were not significant determinants of reuse.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A brief review on algorithmic fairness;,citation_abstract=Abstract Machine learning algorithms are widely used in management systems in different fields, such as employee recruitment, loan provision, disease diagnosis, etc., and even in some risky decision-making areas, playing an increasingly crucial role in decisions affecting people’s lives and social development. However, the use of algorithms for automated decision-making can cause unintentional biases that lead to discrimination against certain specific groups. In this context, it is crucial to develop machine learning algorithms that are not only accurate but also fair. There is an extensive discussion of algorithmic fairness in the existing literature. Many scholars have proposed and tested definitions of fairness and attempted to address the problem of unfairness or discrimination in algorithms. This review aims to outline different definitions of algorithmic fairness and to introduce the procedure for constructing fair algorithms to enhance fairness in machine learning. First, this review divides the definitions of algorithmic fairness into two categories, namely, awareness-based fairness and rationality-based fairness, and discusses existing representative algorithmic fairness concepts and notions based on the two categories. Then, metrics for unfairness/discrimination identification are summarized and different unfairness/discrimination removal approaches are discussed to facilitate a better understanding of how algorithmic fairness can be implemented in different scenarios.

For each question, we provide thorough empirical evaluation on tabular datasets derived from the US Census, and present constructive recommendations for the machine learning community. First, we advocate for supplementing domain knowledge with empirical validation when choosing which demographic attribute labels to train on, while always evaluating on the full set of demographic attributes. Second, we warn against using data imbalance techniques without considering their normative implications and suggest an alternative using the structure in the data. Third, we introduce new evaluation metrics which are more appropriate for the intersectional setting.

METHODS: We used smartphone tracking and daily survey data from 225 college student participants, applied four methods (survey construct automation, cosinor regression, non-parametric method, Fourier analysis) on two types of smartphone sensor data (GPS, accelerometer) to characterize CR. We explored the inter-relations among the extracted circadian metrics as well as between the circadian metrics and participants’ self-reported mood and sleep outcomes. RESULTS: Compared to GPS signals, smartphone accelerometer activity follows an intradaily distribution that starts earlier in the day, winds down later, reaches half cumulative activity about the same time, conforms less to a sinusoidal wave, and exhibits more intradaily fragmentation but higher CR strength and lower interdaily disruption. We found a notable negative correlation between intradaily variability and CR strength especially pronounced in GPS activity. Self-reported sleep and mood outcomes showed significant correlations with particular CR metrics.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Leveraging Routine Behavior and Contextually-Filtered Features for Depression Detection among College Students;,citation_abstract=The rate of depression in college students is rising, which is known to increase suicide risk, lower academic performance and double the likelihood of dropping out of school. Existing work on finding relationships between passively sensed behavior and depression, as well as detecting depression, mainly derives relevant unimodal features from a single sensor. However, co-occurrence of values in multiple sensors may provide better features, because such features can describe behavior in context. We present a new method to extract contextually filtered features from passively collected, time-series mobile data via association rule mining. After calculating traditional unimodal features from the data, we extract rules that relate unimodal features to each other using association rule mining. We extract rules from each class separately (e.g., depression vs. non-depression). We introduce a new metric to select a subset of rules that distinguish between the two classes. From these rules, which capture the relationship between multiple unimodal features, we automatically extract contextually filtered features. These features are then fed into a traditional machine learning pipeline to detect the class of interest (in our case, depression), defined by whether a student has a high BDI-II score at the end of the semester. The behavior rules generated by our methods are highly interpretable representations of differences between classes. Our best model uses contextually-filtered features to significantly outperform a standard model that uses only unimodal features, by an average of 9.7% across a variety of metrics. We further verified the generalizability of our approach on a second dataset, and achieved very similar results.;,citation_author=Xuhai Xu;,citation_author=Prerna Chikersal;,citation_author=Afsaneh Doryab;,citation_author=Daniella K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Fairness Constraints: Mechanisms for Fair Classification;,citation_abstract=Algorithmic decision making systems are ubiquitous across a wide variety of online as well as offline services. These systems rely on complex learning methods and vast amounts of data to optimize the service functionality, satisfaction of the end user and profitability. However, there is a growing concern that these automated decisions can lead, even in the absence of intent, to a lack of fairness, i.e., their outcomes can disproportionately hurt (or, benefit) particular groups of people sharing one or more sensitive attributes (e.g., race, sex). In this paper, we introduce a flexible mechanism to design fair classifiers by leveraging a novel intuitive measure of decision boundary (un)fairness. We instantiate this mechanism with two well-known classifiers, logistic regression and support vector machines, and show on real-world data that our mechanism allows for a fine-grained control on the degree of fairness, often at a small cost in terms of accuracy.;,citation_author=Muhammad Bilal Zafar;,citation_author=Isabel Valera;,citation_author=Manuel Gomez Rogriguez;,citation_author=Krishna P.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>About 1 in 10 adults in the United States met diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder (AUD) in 2022 <span class="citation" data-cites="Highlights2022National">(<a href="#ref-Highlights2022National" role="doc-biblioref"><span>“Highlights for the 2022 <span>National Survey</span> on <span>Drug Use</span> and <span>Health</span>,”</span> n.d.</a>)</span>. While some individuals will experience natural recovery (i.e., improvement without intervention) <span class="citation" data-cites="tuckerEpidemiologyRecoveryAlcohol2020">(<a href="#ref-tuckerEpidemiologyRecoveryAlcohol2020" role="doc-biblioref">Tucker, Chandler, and Witkiewitz 2020</a>)</span>, for others AUD will present as a chronic, relapsing disorder marked by periods of recovery interspersed with returns back to harmful use <span class="citation" data-cites="ScienceDrugUse brandonRelapseRelapsePrevention2007a">(<a href="#ref-ScienceDrugUse" role="doc-biblioref"><span>“The <span>Science</span> of <span>Drug Use</span> and <span>Addiction</span>: <span>The Basics</span> <span></span> <span>NIDA Archives</span>”</span> n.d.</a>; <a href="#ref-brandonRelapseRelapsePrevention2007a" role="doc-biblioref">Brandon, Vidrine, and Litvin 2007</a>)</span>. For such individuals, continued monitoring may be beneficial in assisting with the maintenance of recovery goals and in identifying precipitants to lapses, or single instances of goal-inconsistent use that may lead to relapse <span class="citation" data-cites="witkiewitzRelapsePreventionAlcohol2004a">(<a href="#ref-witkiewitzRelapsePreventionAlcohol2004a" role="doc-biblioref">Witkiewitz and Marlatt 2004</a>)</span>. One sustainable and scalable way to provide this continuous monitoring to individuals who need it most is through developing algorithms to predict lapses using both personal sensing data and machine learning.</p>
<p>Personal sensing data are data derived via embedded sensors in technology ubiquitous in our daily lives, such as smartphones, smartwatches, or other wearables <span class="citation" data-cites="mohrPersonalSensingUnderstanding2017a">(<a href="#ref-mohrPersonalSensingUnderstanding2017a" role="doc-biblioref">Mohr, Zhang, and Schueller 2017</a>)</span>. Because these devices are already so integrated within our day-to-day lives, one benefit of porting these data to clinical use is their proven ability to be collected unobtrusively and continuously. Importantly, these data do not require individuals to change their behavior or routines in any way. Moreover, when paired with machine learning models, statistical patterns connecting antecedents to lapse derived from these data (e.g., changes in mood, difficulty with close social connections, proximity to risky locations) to true lapse events can be uncovered. This is crucial for several reasons: 1) even when someone anticipates an oncoming lapse, it may be difficult to pinpoint the specific driving forces behind it; 2) these precipitating factors will have great variation both between- and within-people; and 3) uncovering these factors may help relieve some of the cognitive burden of recovery (i.e., constant monitoring of potential environmental risk factors).</p>
<section id="geolocation-data-for-risk-monitoring" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="geolocation-data-for-risk-monitoring">Geolocation Data for Risk Monitoring</h3>
<p>Recovery and return to use are dynamic processes. Factors that contribute both to maintenance of recovery and return to use change from person-to-person and from moment-to-moment. A shift in social supports (e.g., a move, a break-up) may precede a lapse for one individual but not another. Time spent in locations where alcohol is available (e.g., bars, restaurants, concert venues) may precede a given lapse for another individual, but will not necessarily precede future lapses in that same individual. In order to best capture this fluidity, the ideal data type used within continuous risk monitoring systems should be able to provide a correspondingly appropriate level of granularity. One promising data source is geolocation data.</p>
<p>Geolocation data consist of latitude and longtitude coordinates and can be sampled at regular intervals using applications on smartphones with little to no input from the user beyond initial set-up. Many smartphones and smartwatches automatically collect these data by default. This fact, paired with increasing rates of smartphone ownership, suggest that there is high potential for these data to be feasibly harnessed for use in a risk-monitoring system <span class="citation" data-cites="areanMobileTechnologyMental2016">(<a href="#ref-areanMobileTechnologyMental2016" role="doc-biblioref">Areàn, Hoa Ly, and Andersson 2016</a>)</span>. The importance of location, such as environmental cues or one’s perceived riskiness of a setting, has been shown to play an important role in lapse <span class="citation" data-cites="janakPotentEffectEnvironmental2010 waltonIndividualSocialEnvironmental2003 waltonSocialSettingsAddiction1995">(<a href="#ref-janakPotentEffectEnvironmental2010" role="doc-biblioref">Janak and Chaudhri 2010</a>; <a href="#ref-waltonIndividualSocialEnvironmental2003" role="doc-biblioref">Maureen A. Walton et al. 2003</a>; <a href="#ref-waltonSocialSettingsAddiction1995" role="doc-biblioref">M. A. Walton, Reischl, and Ramanthan 1995</a>)</span>. This link with lapse risk has translated into the integration of coping skills that target substance-associated contexts in several treatment strategies like mindfulness-based relapse prevention <span class="citation" data-cites="lecocqConsideringDrugAssociatedContexts2020">(<a href="#ref-lecocqConsideringDrugAssociatedContexts2020" role="doc-biblioref">LeCocq et al. 2020</a>)</span>. These findings underscore not only the potential wealth of information relating to relapse risk that an individual’s location can provide, but also demonstrate the proven integration of location information into treatment. Furthermore, geolocation data have been specifically identified as being of particular use in both understanding the precipitants to harmful substance use and its effective treatment <span class="citation" data-cites="stahlerGeospatialTechnologyExposome2013">(<a href="#ref-stahlerGeospatialTechnologyExposome2013" role="doc-biblioref">Stahler, Mennis, and Baron 2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Within the substance use literature, geolocation data have historically been used to examine risky locations, such as the influence of neighborhood characteristics on use <span class="citation" data-cites="epsteinRealtimeTrackingNeighborhood2014a kwanUncertaintiesGeographicContext2019">(<a href="#ref-epsteinRealtimeTrackingNeighborhood2014a" role="doc-biblioref">Epstein et al. 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-kwanUncertaintiesGeographicContext2019" role="doc-biblioref">Kwan et al. 2019</a>)</span> and individual physical proximity to locations of potential or past harmful use such as bars (either estimated using geofencing or user-defined) <span class="citation" data-cites="attwoodUsingMobileHealth2017 carreiroRealizeAnalyzeEngage2021 gonzalezComparisonSmartphoneApp2015 gustafsonSmartphoneApplicationSupport2014a naughtonContextSensingMobilePhone2016">(<a href="#ref-attwoodUsingMobileHealth2017" role="doc-biblioref">Attwood et al. 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-carreiroRealizeAnalyzeEngage2021" role="doc-biblioref">Carreiro et al. 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-gonzalezComparisonSmartphoneApp2015" role="doc-biblioref">Gonzalez and Dulin 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-gustafsonSmartphoneApplicationSupport2014a" role="doc-biblioref">Gustafson et al. 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-naughtonContextSensingMobilePhone2016" role="doc-biblioref">Naughton et al. 2016</a>)</span>. Several of the applications implemented in these studies enable real-time notifications about locations to their users (e.g., a pop-up message on a smartphone which reads <em>“You are entering a high-risk zone”</em>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, affective scientists have focused instead more closely on factors relating to mood. Geolocation data have been used to estimate loneliness and isolation <span class="citation" data-cites="doryabIdentifyingBehavioralPhenotypes2019a">(<a href="#ref-doryabIdentifyingBehavioralPhenotypes2019a" role="doc-biblioref">Doryab et al. 2019</a>)</span>, to demonstrate increases in positive affect from seeking out novel environments <span class="citation" data-cites="hellerAssociationRealworldExperiential2020">(<a href="#ref-hellerAssociationRealworldExperiential2020" role="doc-biblioref">Heller et al. 2020</a>)</span>, and to quantify depressive symptoms <span class="citation" data-cites="raughGeolocationDigitalPhenotyping2020">(<a href="#ref-raughGeolocationDigitalPhenotyping2020" role="doc-biblioref">Raugh et al. 2020</a>)</span>. Moreover, these data have not only been harnessed to measure mood symptoms, but to also predict their emergence <span class="citation" data-cites="shinSystematicReviewLocation2023">(for review, see <a href="#ref-shinSystematicReviewLocation2023" role="doc-biblioref">Shin and Bae 2023</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>An integration across these subfields can be in part accomplished by enriching geolocation data with brief, intermittent surveys probing specific information about frequently visited locations. For example, some of the more nuanced facets captured within location are associations with others (or lack thereof, e.g., social isolation), associations with previous drinking behaviors (e.g., whether or not alcohol is present), and associations with affect (i.e., negative versus positive emotions tied to a given location).</p>
<!--needs to be a better link here, pending addition of fairness analyses-->
</section>
<section id="model-evaluation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-evaluation">Model Evaluation</h3>
<p>Data selection, however, is only one component of the successful development of a continuous risk monitoring algorithm. Following algorithm development, it is imperative that these models be rigorously evaluated using performance metrics and eventually tested using independent observations (i.e., using data from individuals which were not used in model development). This workflow in machine learning is what enables researchers to anticipate how well a model could be expected to generalize to new populations and is key when aiming to develop algorithms for real-world healthcare implementation. While standard performance metrics like model accuracy, for example, have been standard reporting practice for years, recent literature has begun to urge researchers to also include assessments of how <em>fair</em> a model is <span class="citation" data-cites="rajkomarEnsuringFairnessMachine2018a wawiragichoyaEquityEssenceCall2021">(<a href="#ref-rajkomarEnsuringFairnessMachine2018a" role="doc-biblioref">Rajkomar et al. 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-wawiragichoyaEquityEssenceCall2021" role="doc-biblioref">Wawira Gichoya et al. 2021</a>)</span>. A fair algorithm is one with no preference in performance with respect to inherent or acquired characteristics (e.g., gender, race, socioeconomic status; <span class="citation" data-cites="wangBriefReviewAlgorithmic2022">(<a href="#ref-wangBriefReviewAlgorithmic2022" role="doc-biblioref">X. Wang, Zhang, and Zhu 2022</a>)</span>). In the context of a continuous risk monitoring algorithm for AUD, this would mean that lapse predictions are reasonably accurate and do not favor or disadvantage any particular group.</p>
<p>The motivating factors behind this call to action are clear. In the broader context of health-related data, historical patterns of health care inequities will almost certainly and unavoidably be embedded within data used to train algorithms. These inequities may unintentionally be carried forward in perpetuity by machine learning models if not critically examined. Without examining algorithmic fairness prior to deployment in the real-world, monitoring algorithms run the risk of providing sub-optimal mental health care to individuals who already face disadvantages.</p>
<p>For example, having a limited number of observations within underrepresented groups means that our models will not have as wide a range of individuals to learn from for making predictions of lapse as compared to white, non-Hispanic participants. Performance of these models for racialized minority individuals may therefore be less accurate as a result, particularly without the use of resampling techniques to amend these imbalances <span class="citation" data-cites="japkowiczClassImbalanceProblem2000 wangIntersectionalityMachineLearning2022">(<a href="#ref-japkowiczClassImbalanceProblem2000" role="doc-biblioref">Japkowicz 2000</a>; <a href="#ref-wangIntersectionalityMachineLearning2022" role="doc-biblioref">A. Wang, Ramaswamy, and Russakovsky 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Fairness is also a particular concern specifically in the context of AUD, where the literature has historically been built upon research developed with male, predominantly white, participants. Despite the call to action brought forth by the NIH through their <em>Guidelines on Inclusion of Women and Minorities in Research</em>, recent work has highlighted that seminal research in the field on medications for the treatment of AUD have failed to consistently report participant demographics <span class="citation" data-cites="schickCallActionSystematic2020">(<a href="#ref-schickCallActionSystematic2020" role="doc-biblioref">Schick, Spillane, and Hostetler 2020</a>)</span>. This lack of reporting makes it difficult to assess how and if this lack of representation is being corrected. By the very nature of its historically limited participant pool, AUD research and its theory have been developed from a particular perspective using a particular group of individuals. This means that the variables that researchers decide are important to measure and input into models, informed by knowledge of AUD theory, will inherently be biased and may favor these groups. Therefore, researchers can also not assume that balanced classes are enough to compensate for biases brought on by the broader societal context. Both of these facts motivate the reasoning behind examining algorithmic fairness in the context of developing continuous risk monitoring systems.</p>

<section id="the-current-study" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-current-study">The Current Study</h3>
<p>In order for these continuous risk monitoring systems to be implemented in the real-world, these models must both be developed outright and rigorously evaluated on both standard performance metrics and algorithmic fairness. To this end, this study utilized geolocation data collected from smartphones and corresponding self-reported contextual information for frequently visited locations to build a machine learning model to predict next-day alcohol use lapse among individuals with a diagnosis of AUD and a recovery goal of abstinence. Model features were engineered from both raw geolocation data, both context-dependent and context agnostic, and change in these data over the previous 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 168 hours.</p>
<p>Here we present characterization of model performance for this prediction model in a validation set. We also evaluated feature importance and model fairness. <!--will need to circle back to this and expand--> This study constitutes a preliminary evaluation of a model designed to predict lapse back to alcohol use using minimally burdensome data that has the potential to be integrated within a continuous risk monitoring platform.</p>

<p>One hundred and forty six individuals in early-recovery (1-8 weeks of abstinence) for AUD were recruited from the Madison area to take part in a three-month study on how mobile health technology can provide recovery support between 2017 and 2019 (R01 AA024391). Recruitment approaches included social media platforms (e.g., Facebook), television and radio advertisements, and clinic referrals. Prospective participants completed a phone screen to assess match with eligibility criteria (<a href="#tbl-elig" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;1</a>). Participants were excluded if they exhibited severe symptoms of paranoia or psychosis (a score &lt;= 2.24 on the SCL-90 psychosis scale or a score &lt;= 2.82 on the SCL-90 paranoia scale administered at screening).</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="procedure">Procedure</h3>
<p>Participants enrolled in a three-month study consisting of five in-person visits, daily surveys, and continuous passive monitoring of geolocation data. Following screening and enrollment visits in which participants consented to participate, learned how to manage location sharing (i.e., turn off location sharing when desired), and reported frequently visited locations, participants completed three follow-up visits one month apart. At each visit, participants were asked questions about frequently visited (&gt;2 times during the course of the previous month) locations. Participants were debriefed at the third and final follow-up visit. Participants were expected to provide continuous geolocation data while on study. Other personal sensing data streams (EMA, cellular communications, sleep quality, and audio check-ins) were collected as part of the parent grant’s aims (R01 AA024391).</p>
</section>
<section id="geolocation-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="geolocation-data">Geolocation data</h3>
<p>To enable collection of geolocation data, participants downloaded either the Moves app or the FollowMee app during the intake visit. Moves was bought-out and subsequently deprecated while the study was ongoing (July 2018) and data collection continued using FollowMee until the end of the study. Both apps continuously tracked location via GPS and WiFi positioning technology.</p>
<p>Data were then processed to filter out duplicated points, fast movement speeds (&gt;100mph), sudden positional jumps, and periods of long duration suggesting sampling error issues (&gt;24 hours with no movement or &gt;2 hours with a positional jump of more than 0.31 miles or 500 meters).

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lapses">Lapses</h3>
<p>Alcohol lapses were used as the outcome variable in this study and were used to provide labels for model training, for testing model performance, and for testing issues of algorithmic fairness across our predefined subgroups. Future lapse occurrence (here conceptualized as next-day lapse) was be predicted in 24-hour windows, beginning at 4:00am on a participant’s second day of participation to ensure one full day of data collection for the first window, and at every subsequent day on study thereafter. <em>Lapse</em> and <em>no lapse</em> occurrences were identified from the daily survey question, <em>“Have you drank any alcohol that you have not yet reported?”</em>. Participants who responded <em>yes</em> to this question were then asked to report the date and hour of the start and the end of the drinking episode. In this case, the prediction window was labeled <em>lapse</em>. Prediction windows were labeled <em>no lapse</em> if no alcohol use was reported within that window.</p>

<section id="feature-engineering" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feature-engineering">Feature engineering</h3>
<p>Feature engineering is the process of creating variables (or <em>“features”</em>) from unprocessed data and was used to transform raw data from geolocation data collected the prior day.</p>
<p>Features from geolocation data were generated that utilized both contextual information collected from monthly surveys (e.g., location valence, perceived riskiness) as well as features that were independent of further individual input (e.g., location variance, time spent out of the home in the evening). <!--list out all features? maybe make table?--> All features were calculated both as raw and change features based on previous geolocation data (i.e., change from past 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 168 hour periods) in order to capture individual variation.</p>
<p>Imputation of missing data and removal of zero-variance features are additional general processing steps that will also be undertaken during feature engineering.</p>
</section>
<section id="algorithm-development-performance" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="algorithm-development-performance">Algorithm development &amp; performance</h3>
<!--worthwhile to mention glmnet?-->
<p>Several configurations of the XGBoost machine learning algorithm were considered which varied across a relevant and appropriate range of model-specific hyperparameters (mtry, tree depth, learning rate) as well as resampling techniques (up-sampling of the positive class, lapse, and down-sampling of the negative class, no lapse).</p>
<p>Models were trained and assessed using participant-grouped, nested <em>k</em>-fold cross-validation. Grouped cross-validation assigns all data from a participant as either held-in or held-out to avoid bias introduced when predicting a participant’s data from their own data. Nested cross-validation uses two nested loops for dividing and holding out folds: an outer loop, where held-out folds serve as test sets for model evaluation; and inner loops, where held-out folds serve as validation sets for model selection. Importantly, these sets are independent, maintaining separation between data used to train the models, select the best models, and evaluate those best models. Therefore, nested cross-validation removes optimization bias from the evaluation of model performance in the test sets and can yield lower variance performance estimates than single test set approaches <span class="citation" data-cites="jonathanUseCrossvalidationAssess2000">(<a href="#ref-jonathanUseCrossvalidationAssess2000" role="doc-biblioref">Jonathan, Krzanowski, and McCarthy 2000</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The primary performance metric for model selection and evaluation of the validation set was area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (auROC) <span class="citation" data-cites="kuhnAppliedPredictiveModeling2018">(<a href="#ref-kuhnAppliedPredictiveModeling2018" role="doc-biblioref">Kuhn and Johnson 2018</a>)</span>. auROC indexes the probability that the model will predict a higher score for a randomly selected positive case (lapse) relative to a randomly selected negative case (no lapse). This metric was selected because it 1) combines sensitivity and specificity, which are both important characteristics for clinical implementation; 2) is an aggregate metric across all decision thresholds, which is important because optimal decision thresholds may differ across settings and goals; and 3) is unaffected by class imbalance, which is important for comparing models with differing prediction window widths and levels of class imbalance. The best model configuration was selected using median auROC across all validation sets. Several secondary performance metrics including sensitivity, specificity, balanced accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) will also be assessed.</p>
<p>SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values were computed as interpretability metrics to identify the relative importance of different features in each final algorithm. SHAP values measure the unique contribution of features in an algorithm’s predictions <span class="citation" data-cites="lundbergUnifiedApproachInterpreting2017">(<a href="#ref-lundbergUnifiedApproachInterpreting2017" role="doc-biblioref">Lundberg and Lee 2017</a>)</span>. SHAP values possess several useful properties including: <em>Additivity</em> (SHAP values for each feature can be computed independently and summed); <em>Efficiency</em> (the sum of SHAP values across features must add up to the difference between predicted and observed outcomes for each observation); <em>Symmetry</em> (SHAP values for two features should be equal if the two features contribute equally to all possible coalitions); and <em>Dummy</em> (a feature that does not change the predicted value in any coalition will have a SHAP value of 0). Highly important features represent relevant, actionable potential antecedents to lapse (and therefore points of intervention) that will be relevant in the future development of a continuous risk monitoring system. However, these are descriptive analyses because standard errors or other indices of uncertainty for importance scores are not available for SHAP values.</p>
<p>Finally, a Bayesian hierarchical generalized linear model was used to estimate the posterior probability distributions and 95% Bayesian credible intervals (CIs) for auROC.</p>

<p>Subgroups were defined on the basis of personal individual characteristics (in the machine learning fairness literature, “sensitive attributes”) that are specifically associated with treatment disparities in AUD.</p>
<p>A Bayesian hierarchical generalized linear model was used to estimate the posterior probability distributions and 95% Bayesian CIs for auROC across four subgroups of participants: white versus non-white, younger than 55 versus equal to and older than 55, below or above the federal poverty line (citation), and sex (male versus female).</p>

<p>A total of 192 individuals were eligible to participate in the study, of which 191 consented to participate and 169 enrolled in the study. Fifteen participants were excluded prior to the first monthly follow-up visit. One participant was excluded for not maintaining a recovery goal of abstinence during their time on study. Two participants were excluded due to evidence of low compliance and careless responding. A further five individuals were excluded due to poor geolocation data quality as a result of insufficient data (resulting from software incompatibility and/or very limited mobility), resulting in a final sample size of 146.</p>
<p>The average age of the final sample was 40.9 years (SD = 12 years, range = 21-72 years). There was an approximately equal number of men (n = 74, 50.7%) and women (n = 72, 49.3%). The majority of the sample was White/Caucasian (n = 127, 86.99%) and non-Hispanic (n = 142, n = 97%). The mean income of participants was $34,408 (SD = $32,259, range = $0-$200,000). On average, participants self-reported a mean number of 8.9 DSM-V symptoms of AUD (range = 4-11).

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-evaluation-1">Model Evaluation</h3>
<p>We selected and evaluated the best performing XGBoost model from our validation set. This may result in a slight optimism bias in our model performance, though we believe this is largely offset through our use of 10 x 30 cross-validation (which averages model performance across 300 folds). However, evaluating the validation set was important to do because model development is still in progress, and as such it would not have been appropriate to examine independent test set performance at this stage.</p>
<p>The median auROC across the 300 folds achieved fair performance (<em>Mdn</em> = 0.712). <a href="#fig-auroc-histogram" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a> displays a histogram of model performance distribution across all folds. A receiver operating characteristic curve is displayed in <a href="#fig-auroc-plot" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a>, representing aggregate predicted lapse probabilities across all 300 folds of the validation set.</p>
<p>Posterior probability distributions for the auROCs for our best performing validation set model were used to formally characterize model performance. The median auROC was 0.714 (95% CI [0.70-0.73]), indicating that there is a probability &gt; .95 that our model is performing above chance (i.e., auROC &gt; .5; <a href="#fig-pp" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3</a>).</p>
<p>Finally, we performed model calibration in order to improve our trust in model predictions. Results of model calibration are displayed in <a href="#fig-calibration" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;4</a>, showing that this model <em>over</em> predicts lapse probability even after calibrating the model. In other words, our model is more likely to predict that an individual will lapse than the true rate of lapse in our sample.</p>

<p>Global importance (mean absolute Shapley values) for feature categories is shown in <a href="#fig-shaps-group" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5</a>. Three aggregated feature categories were identified as being particularly important in contributing to model predictions: time spent at risky locations, time spent at different types of location, and time spent at locations with varying levels of alcohol availability. Other aggregated feature groups, both context-supplemented and without, did not appear to be strong and unique global contributors to model predictions.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Our day-level model of lapse prediction using geolocation data performs adequately well. Models which perform at around the .7 threshold are considered to have “fair” performance. This suggests that, while there is still substantial room for improvement in model performance, geolocation data can predict future alcohol lapse in the next day with fair sensitivity and specificity.</p></li>
<li><p>Calibration is more sensitive than true lapse rate in sample, suggesting that it overpredicts occurrence of lapses</p></li>
<li><p>This is not necessarily an issue if we are trying to quantify relative risk to individuals using a risk monitoring system</p></li>
<li><p>Top performing Shapley values were time spent at risky locations, time spent at different types of location, and time spent at locations with varying levels of alcohol availability.</p></li>
<li><p>These features were all generated utilizing additional context supplied by participants after a given location was identified as frequently visited (&gt; 2x in the previous month).</p></li>
<li><p>It should be noted that these features have potential to be generated without user feedback (i.e., using consumer and other publicly available data to identify establishments that sell alcohol, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>This could potentially reduce burden further by not requiring individual input</p></li>
<li><p>However, self-classifying locations as risky might be encoding nuance that could not be feasibly obtained using public data. For example, a location might be labeled as risky from user input because it is a person-specific triggering location (e.g., scene of a traumatic event).</p></li>
<li><p>Interestingly, location valence (i.e., the emotion tied to a given location) is the fourth-highest Shapley value, yet appears to be minimally contributing to model predictions. This may be because participants were asked retrospectively about these locations at one month follow-up visits, and so our measures of emotional quality of a location may be too distal to be meaningful (particularly when compared to daily EMA).</p></li>
<li><p>Location to avoid in recovery and previous drinking location – poor insight so low predictive ability?</p></li>
<li><p>Transitory movement, location variance, time spent out of home in the evening – lacking individual input from participants, not easily tied to meaningful lapse risk factors</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This study demonstrates that it is feasible to predict lapse with a fair level of accuracy using geolocation data, suggesting that geolocation data is a viable supplement for risk prediction monitoring systems. Moreover, our model demonstrates similar performance across vulnerable subgroups. Moving forward, additional risk-relevant features will be added to the model in an effort to improve prediction and the final model will be evaluated.</p>
