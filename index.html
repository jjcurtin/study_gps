<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mobile technology for mental health assessment;,citation_abstract=Assessment and outcome monitoring are critical for the effective detection and treatment of mental illness. Traditional methods of capturing social, functional, and behavioral data are limited to the information that patients report back to their health care provider at selected points in time. As a result, these data are not accurate accounts of day-to-day functioning, as they are often influenced by biases in self-report. Mobile technology (mobile applications on smartphones, activity bracelets) has the potential to overcome such problems with traditional assessment and provide information about patient symptoms, behavior, and functioning in real time. Although the use of sensors and apps are widespread, several questions remain in the field regarding the reliability of off-the-shelf apps and sensors, use of these tools by consumers, and provider use of these data in clinical decision-making.;,citation_author=Patricia A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Using a mobile health application to reduce alcohol consumption: A mixed-methods evaluation of the drinkaware track &amp;amp;amp; calculate units application;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Smartphone applications (&amp;amp;quot;apps&amp;quot;) offer promise as tools to help people monitor and reduce their alcohol consumption. To date, few evaluations of alcohol reduction apps exist, with even fewer considering apps already available to the public. The aim of this study was to evaluate an existing publically available app, designed by Drinkaware, a UK-based alcohol awareness charity. METHODS: We adopted a mixed-methods design, analysing routinely collected app usage data to explore user characteristics and patterns of usage. Following this, in-depth interviews were conducted with a sub-sample of app users to examine perceptions of acceptability, usability and perceived effectiveness, as well as to provide recommendations on how to improve the app. RESULTS: One hundred nineteen thousand seven hundred thirteen people downloaded and entered data into the app over a 13-month period. High attrition was observed after 1 week. Users who engaged with the app tended to be &quot;high risk&quot; drinkers and to report being motivated &quot;to reduce drinking&quot; at the point of first download. In those who consistently engaged with the app over time, self-reported alcohol consumption levels reduced, with most change occurring in the first week of usage. Our qualitative findings indicate satisfaction with the usability of the app, but mixed feedback was given regarding individual features. Users expressed conflicting views concerning the type of feedback and notifications that the app currently provides. A common preference was expressed for more personalised content. CONCLUSIONS: The Drinkaware app is a useful tool to support behaviour change in individuals who are already motivated and committed to reducing their alcohol consumption. The Drinkaware app would benefit from greater personalisation and tailoring to promote longer term use. This evaluation provides insight into the usability and acceptability of various app features and contains a number of recommendations for improving user satisfaction and the potential effectiveness of apps designed to encourage reductions in alcohol consumption.;,citation_author=Sophie Attwood;,citation_author=Hannah Parke;,citation_author=John Larsen;,citation_author=Katie L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cue dependency of nicotine self-administration and smoking;,citation_abstract=A paradox exists regarding the reinforcing properties of nicotine. The abuse liability associated with smoking equals or exceeds that of other addictive drugs, yet the euphoric, reinforcing and other psychological effects of nicotine, compared to these other drugs, are more subtle, are manifest under more restricted conditions, and do not readily predict the difficulty most smokers experience in achieving abstinence. One possible resolution to this apparent inconsistency is that environmental cues associated with drug delivery become conditioned reinforcers and take on powerful incentive properties that are critically important for sustaining smoking in humans and nicotine self-administration in animals. We tested this hypothesis by using a widely employed self-administration paradigm in which rats press a lever at high rates for 1 h/day to obtain intravenous infusions of nicotine that are paired with two types of visual stimuli: a chamber light that when turned on signals drug availability and a 1-s cue light that signals drug delivery. We show that these visual cues are at least as important as nicotine in sustaining a high rate of responding once self-administration has been established, in the degree to which withdrawing nicotine extinguishes the behavior, and in the reinstatement of lever pressing after extinction. Additional studies demonstrated that the importance of these cues was manifest under both fixed ratio and progressive ratio (PR) schedules of reinforcement. The possibility that nicotine-paired cues are as important as nicotine in smoking behavior should refocus our attention on the psychology and neurobiology of conditioned reinforcers in order to stimulate the development of more effective treatment programs for smoking cessation.;,citation_author=A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Realize, Analyze, Engage (RAE): A Digital Tool to Support Recovery from Substance Use Disorder;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Substance use disorders are a highly prevalent group of chronic diseases with devastating individual and public health consequences. Current treatment strategies suffer from high rates of relapse, or return to drug use, and novel solutions are desperately needed. Realize Analyze Engage (RAE) is a digital, mHealth intervention that focusses on real time, objective detection of high-risk events (stress and drug craving) to deploy just-in-time supportive interventions. The present study aims to (1) evaluate the accuracy and usability of the RAE system and (2) evaluate the impact of RAE on patient centered outcomes. METHODS: The first phase of the study will be an observational trial of N = 50 participants in outpatient treatment for SUD using the RAE system for 30 days. Accuracy of craving and stress detection algorithms will be evaluated, and usability of RAE will be explored via semi-structured interviews with participants and focus groups with SUD treatment clinicians. The second phase of the study will be a randomized controlled trial of RAE vs usual care to evaluate rates of return to use, retention in treatment, and quality of life. ANTICIPATED FINDINGS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS: The RAE platform is a potentially powerful tool to de-escalate stress and craving outside of the clinical milieu, and to connect with a support system needed most. RAE also aims to provide clinicians with actionable insight to understand patientsâ level of risk, and contextual clues for their triggers in order to provide more personalized recovery support.;,citation_author=Stephanie Carreiro;,citation_author=Melissa Taylor;,citation_author=Sloke Shrestha;,citation_author=Megan Reinhardt;,citation_author=Nicole Gilbertson;,citation_author=Premananda Indic;,citation_publication_date=2021;,citation_cover_date=2021;,citation_year=2021;,citation_doi=10.20900/jpbs.20210002;,citation_issn=2398-385X;,citation_volume=6;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Psychiatry and Brain Science;,citation_journal_abbrev=J Psychiatr Brain Sci;">

This article introduces issues of discrimination to the data science community on its own terms. In it, we tour the familiar data mining process while providing a taxonomy of common practices that have the potential to produce unintended discrimination. We also survey how discrimination is commonly measured, and suggest how familiar development processes can be augmented to mitigate systemsâ discriminatory potential. We advocate that data scientists should be intentional about modeling and reducing discriminatory outcomes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Digital health tools for the passive monitoring of depression: A systematic review of methods;,citation_abstract=Abstract The use of digital tools to measure physiological and behavioural variables of potential relevance to mental health is a growing field sitting at the intersection between computer science, engineering, and clinical science. We summarised the literature on remote measuring technologies, mapping methodological challenges and threats to reproducibility, and identified leading digital signals for depression. Medical and computer science databases were searched between January 2007 and November 2019. Published studies linking depression and objective behavioural data obtained from smartphone and wearable device sensors in adults with unipolar depression and healthy subjects were included. A descriptive approach was taken to synthesise study methodologies. We included 51 studies and found threats to reproducibility and transparency arising from failure to provide comprehensive descriptions of recruitment strategies, sample information, feature construction and the determination and handling of missing data. The literature is characterised by small sample sizes, short follow-up duration and great variability in the quality of reporting, limiting the interpretability of pooled results. Bivariate analyses show consistency in statistically significant associations between depression and digital features from sleep, physical activity, location, and phone use data. Machine learning models found the predictive value of aggregated features. Given the pitfalls in the combined literature, these results should be taken purely as a starting point for hypothesis generation. Since this research is ultimately aimed at informing clinical practice, we recommend improvements in reporting standards including consideration of generalisability and reproducibility, such as wider diversity of samples, thorough reporting methodology and the reporting of potential bias in studies with numerous features.;,citation_author=Valeria De Angel;,citation_author=Serena Lewis;,citation_author=Katie White;,citation_author=Carolin Oetzmann;,citation_author=Daniel Leightley;,citation_author=Emanuela Oprea;,citation_author=Grace Lavelle;,citation_author=Faith Matcham;,citation_author=Alice Pace;,citation_author=David C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Identifying Behavioral Phenotypes of Loneliness and Social Isolation with Passive Sensing: Statistical Analysis, Data Mining and Machine Learning of Smartphone and Fitbit Data;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Feelings of loneliness are associated with poor physical and mental health. Detection of loneliness through passive sensing on personal devices can lead to the development of interventions aimed at decreasing rates of loneliness. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the potential of using passive sensing to infer levels of loneliness and to identify the corresponding behavioral patterns. METHODS: Data were collected from smartphones and Fitbits (Flex 2) of 160 college students over a semester. The participants completed the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) loneliness questionnaire at the beginning and end of the semester. For a classification purpose, the scores were categorized into high (questionnaire score&amp;amp;amp;gt;40) and low (â¤40) levels of loneliness. Daily features were extracted from both devices to capture activity and mobility, communication and phone usage, and sleep behaviors. The features were then averaged to generate semester-level features. We used 3 analytic methods: (1) statistical analysis to provide an overview of loneliness in college students, (2) data mining using the Apriori algorithm to extract behavior patterns associated with loneliness, and (3) machine learning classification to infer the level of loneliness and the change in levels of loneliness using an ensemble of gradient boosting and logistic regression algorithms with feature selection in a leave-one-student-out cross-validation manner. RESULTS: The average loneliness score from the presurveys and postsurveys was above 43 (presurvey SD 9.4 and postsurvey SD 10.4), and the majority of participants fell into the high loneliness category (scores above 40) with 63.8% (102/160) in the presurvey and 58.8% (94/160) in the postsurvey. Scores greater than 1 standard deviation above the mean were observed in 12.5% (20/160) of the participants in both pre- and postsurvey scores. The majority of scores, however, fell between 1 standard deviation below and above the mean (pre=66.9% [107/160] and post=73.1% [117/160]). Our machine learning pipeline achieved an accuracy of 80.2% in detecting the binary level of loneliness and an 88.4% accuracy in detecting change in the loneliness level. The mining of associations between classifier-selected behavioral features and loneliness indicated that compared with students with low loneliness, students with high levels of loneliness were spending less time outside of campus during evening hours on weekends and spending less time in places for social events in the evening on weekdays (support=17% and confidence=92%). The analysis also indicated that more activity and less sedentary behavior, especially in the evening, was associated with a decrease in levels of loneliness from the beginning of the semester to the end of it (support=31% and confidence=92%). CONCLUSIONS: Passive sensing has the potential for detecting loneliness in college students and identifying the associated behavioral patterns. These findings highlight intervention opportunities through mobile technology to reduce the impact of loneliness on individualsâ health and well-being.;,citation_author=Afsaneh Doryab;,citation_author=Daniella K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The accuracy, fairness, and limits of predicting recidivism;,citation_abstract=Should we trust computers to make life-altering decisions in the criminal justice system? , Algorithms for predicting recidivism are commonly used to assess a criminal defendantâs likelihood of committing a crime. These predictions are used in pretrial, parole, and sentencing decisions. Proponents of these systems argue that big data and advanced machine learning make these analyses more accurate and less biased than humans. We show, however, that the widely used commercial risk assessment software COMPAS is no more accurate or fair than predictions made by people with little or no criminal justice expertise. In addition, despite COMPASâs collection of 137 features, the same accuracy can be achieved with a simple linear classifier with only two features.;,citation_author=Julia Dressel;,citation_author=Hany Farid;,citation_publication_date=2018-01-05;,citation_cover_date=2018-01-05;,citation_year=2018;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aao5580;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1126/sciadv.aao5580;,citation_issn=2375-2548;,citation_volume=4;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Science Advances;,citation_journal_abbrev=Sci.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Real-time tracking of neighborhood surroundings and mood in urban drug misusers: Application of a new method to study behavior in its geographical context;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Maladaptive behaviors may be more fully understood and efficiently prevented by ambulatory tools that assess peopleâs ongoing experience in the context of their environment. METHODS: To demonstrate new field-deployable methods for assessing mood and behavior as a function of neighborhood surroundings (geographical momentary assessment; GMA), we collected time-stamped GPS data and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) ratings of mood, stress, and drug craving over 16 weeks at randomly prompted times during the waking hours of opioid-dependent polydrug users receiving methadone maintenance. Locations of EMA entries and participantsâ travel tracks calculated for the 12 before each EMA entry were mapped. Associations between subjective ratings and objective environmental ratings were evaluated at the whole neighborhood and 12-h track levels. RESULTS: Participants (N=27) were compliant with GMA data collection; 3711 randomly prompted EMA entries were matched to specific locations. At the neighborhood level, physical disorder was negatively correlated with negative mood, stress, and heroin and cocaine craving (ps&amp;amp;amp;lt;.0001-.0335); drug activity was negatively correlated with stress, heroin and cocaine craving (ps .0009-.0134). Similar relationships were found for the environments around respondentsâ tracks in the 12h preceding EMA entries. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the feasibility of GMA. The relationships between neighborhood characteristics and participantsâ reports were counterintuitive and counter-hypothesized, and challenge some assumptions about how ostensibly stressful environments are associated with lived experience and how such environments ultimately impair health. GMA methodology may have applications for development of individual- or neighborhood-level interventions.;,citation_author=David H. Epstein;,citation_author=Matthew Tyburski;,citation_author=Ian M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Tracking the When, Where, and With Whom of Alcohol Use: Integrating Ecological Momentary Assessment and Geospatial Data to Examine Risk for Alcohol-Related Problems;,citation_abstract=Prevention researchers have found that drinking in different contexts is related to different alcohol problems. Where and with whom people drink affects the types of alcohol-related problems they experience. Consequently, identifying those contexts that result in the greatest number of problems provides a novel opportunity to target new prevention efforts aimed at those contexts. However, identifying these contexts poses methodological challenges to prevention research. To overcome these challenges, researchers need tools that allow them to gather detailed information about when and where people choose to drink and how contextual factors influence drinking risks. New data collection and analysis techniques, such as activity-space analysis, which examines movement through different contexts, and ecological momentary assessment, which captures microlevel contextual changes as individuals move through their days, can advance the field of alcohol studies by providing detailed information on the use of drinking contexts, particularly when combined.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Structural racism in precision medicine: Leaving no one behind;,citation_abstract=Abstract Background Precision medicine (PM) is an emerging approach to individualized care. It aims to help physicians better comprehend and predict the needs of their patients while effectively adopting in a timely manner the most suitable treatment by promoting the sharing of health data and the implementation of learning healthcare systems. Alongside its promises, PM also entails the risk of exacerbating healthcare inequalities, in particular between ethnoracial groups. One often-neglected underlying reason why this might happen is the impact of structural racism on PM initiatives. Raising awareness as to how structural racism can influence PM initiatives is paramount to avoid that PM ends up reproducing the pre-existing health inequalities between different ethnoracial groups and contributing to the loss of trust in healthcare by minority groups. Main body We analyse three nodes of a process flow where structural racism can affect PMâs implementation. These are: (i) the collection of biased health data during the initial encounter of minority groups with the healthcare system and researchers, (ii) the integration of biased health data for minority groups in PM initiatives and (iii) the influence of structural racism on the deliverables of PM initiatives for minority groups. We underscore that underappreciation of structural racism by stakeholders involved in the PM ecosystem can be at odds with the ambition of ensuring social and racial justice. Potential specific actions related to the analysed nodes are then formulated to help ensure that PM truly adheres to the goal of leaving no one behind , as endorsed by member states of the United Nations for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Conclusion Structural racism has been entrenched in our societies for centuries and it would be naÃ¯ve to believe that its impacts will not spill over in the era of PM. PM initiatives need to pay special attention to the discriminatory and harmful impacts that structural racism could have on minority groups involved in their respective projects. It is only by acknowledging and discussing the existence of implicit racial biases&nbsp;and trust issues in healthcare and research domains that proper interventions to remedy them can be implemented.;,citation_author=Lester Darryl GeneviÃ¨ve;,citation_author=Andrea Martani;,citation_author=David Shaw;,citation_author=Bernice Simone Elger;,citation_author=Tenzin Wangmo;,citation_publication_date=2020-12;,citation_cover_date=2020-12;,citation_year=2020;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-020-0457-8;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1186/s12910-020-0457-8;,citation_issn=1472-6939;,citation_volume=21;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=BMC Medical Ethics;,citation_journal_abbrev=BMC Med Ethics;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Comparison of a smartphone app for alcohol use disorders with an Internet-based intervention plus bibliotherapy: A pilot study;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE: To date, no research has evaluated the efficacy of a stand-alone, smartphone-based intervention for individuals with an alcohol use disorder. The current pilot study evaluated the short-term outcomes of a smartphone-based intervention for alcohol use disorders compared with an Internet-based brief motivational intervention plus bibliotherapy. METHOD: Adults (18 to 45 years old) with an alcohol use disorder received either the Location-Based Monitoring and Intervention for Alcohol Use Disorders (LBMI-A; n = 28), a smartphone-based intervention, or the online Drinkerâs Check-up plus bibliotherapy (DCU + bib; n = 26). These groups were compared using the Timeline Followback interview for percent days abstinent (PDA), percent heavy drinking days (PHDD), and drinks per week (DPW) from baseline to 6 weeks after the introduction of the interventions. RESULTS: Multilevel models revealed that the LBMI-A resulted in a significant increase in PDA over the course of the study, whereas the DCU + bib did not. Effect sizes for change from baseline for PDA suggest that the DCU + bib resulted in moderate a decrease, whereas the LBMI-A resulted in a large increase in PDA. Both interventions resulted in significant decreases in PHDD and DPW. The LBMI-A produced larger reductions in the first 3 to 4 weeks after the intervention was introduced than the DCU + bib. On weeks with greater LBMI-A usage, participants reported less DPW and PHDD. CONCLUSIONS: Both interventions resulted in significant decreases in alcohol use over the 6-week trial, which is promising for stand-alone technology-based intervention systems aimed at individuals with an alcohol use disorder.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=What does âaccess to health careâ mean?;,citation_abstract=Facilitating access is concerned with helping people to command appropriate health care resources in order to preserve or improve their health. Access is a complex concept and at least four aspects require evaluation. If services are available and there is an adequate supply of services, then the opportunity to obtain health care exists, and a population may âhave accessâ to services. The extent to which a population âgains accessâ also depends on financial, organisational and social or cultural barriers that limit the utilisation of services. Thus access measured in terms of utilisation is dependent on the affordability, physical accessibility and acceptability of services and not merely adequacy of supply. Services available must be relevant and effective if the population is to âgain access to satisfactory health outcomesâ. The availability of services, and barriers to access, have to be considered in the context of the differing perspectives, health needs and material and cultural settings of diverse groups in society. Equity of access may be measured in terms of the availability, utilisation or outcomes of services.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Psychiatric Comorbidity as a Function of Severity: DSMâ5 Alcohol Use Disorder and HiTOP Classification of Mental Disorders;,citation_abstract=Background Understanding the comorbidity of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and other psychiatric diagnoses has been a longâstanding interest of researchers and mental health professionals. Comorbidity is often examined via the diagnostic coâoccurrence of discrete, categorical diagnoses, which is incongruent with increasingly supported dimensional approaches of psychiatric classification and diagnosis, and for AUD more specifically. The present study examined associations between DSMâ5 AUD and psychiatric symptoms of other DSMâIV and DSMâ5 disorders categorically, and dimensionally organized according to the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) spectra (e.g., Internalizing, Disinhibited Externalizing). Methods The comorbidity of AUD with other psychological disorders was examined in 2 independent nationally representative samples of pastâyear drinkers via an initial examination in the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) Wave 2 and replicated in NESARCâIII. Results Analyses focusing on psychopathology symptom counts organized by spectra demonstrated that greater AUD severity was associated with a higher number of symptoms across HiTOP spectra. Traditional categorical analyses also demonstrated increasing prevalence as a monotonic function of DSMâ5 AUD severity gradients. Conclusions This study indicates that AUD and other psychiatric disorder comorbidity implies increased presence of multiple forms of psychopathology with a corresponding increased number of symptoms across hierarchical spectra. Greater AUD severity increases the likelihood of other psychopathology and, when present, âmore severeâ presentations. That is, on average, a given disorder (e.g., depression) is more severe when copresenting with an AUD, and increases in severity along with the AUD.;,citation_author=Ashley C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Differential Fairness: An Intersectional Framework for Fair AI;,citation_abstract=We propose definitions of fairness in machine learning and artificial intelligence systems that are informed by the framework of intersectionality, a critical lens from the legal, social science, and humanities literature which analyzes how interlocking systems of power and oppression affect individuals along overlapping dimensions including gender, race, sexual orientation, class, and disability. We show that our criteria behave sensibly for any subset of the set of protected attributes, and we prove economic, privacy, and generalization guarantees. Our theoretical results show that our criteria meaningfully operationalize AI fairness in terms of real-world harms, making the measurements interpretable in a manner analogous to differential privacy. We provide a simple learning algorithm using deterministic gradient methods, which respects our intersectional fairness criteria. The measurement of fairness becomes statistically challenging in the minibatch setting due to data sparsity, which increases rapidly in the number of protected attributes and in the values per protected attribute. To address this, we further develop a practical learning algorithm using stochastic gradient methods which incorporates stochastic estimation of the intersectional fairness criteria on minibatches to scale up to big data. Case studies on census data, the COMPAS criminal recidivism dataset, the HHP hospitalization data, and a loan application dataset from HMDA demonstrate the utility of our methods.;,citation_author=Rashidul Islam;,citation_author=Kamrun Naher Keya;,citation_author=Shimei Pan;,citation_author=Anand D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Potent Effect of Environmental Context on Relapse to Alcohol-Seeking After Extinction;,citation_abstract=Environments in which the pharmacological effects of alcohol have been experienced become potent triggers for relapse in abstinent humans. Animal models developed to study the effect of environmental contexts on relapse to alcohol-seeking behavior demonstrate that alcohol-seeking is renewed by exposure to an alcohol-associated context, following the extinction of alcohol-seeking in a different context. Hence, contexts in which alcohol conditioning and extinction learning occur can be critical determinants for whether or not alcohol-seeking behavior is observed. This review summarizes preclinical research to date examining the role of alcohol contexts on the reinstatement of extinguished responding for alcohol. Behavioral studies have elucidated factors that are important for eliciting context-dependent relapse, and have uncovered novel interactions between alcohol-seeking driven by discrete alcohol cues in different contexts. Neuropharmacological studies provide substantial evidence for a role of dopaminergic systems in context-dependent reinstatement, and growing support for opioidergic mechanisms as well. Several key limbic brain regions have been identified in the modulation of alcohol-seeking by context, supporting a proposed neural circuit that includes the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, basolateral amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, and the paraventricular thalamus.;,citation_author=Patricia H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Considering Drug-Associated Contexts in Substance Use Disorders and Treatment Development;,citation_abstract=Environmental contexts that are reliably associated with the use of pharmacologically active substances are hypothesized to contribute to substance use disorders. In this review, we provide an updated summary of parallel preclinical and human studies that support this hypothesis. Research conducted in rats shows that environmental contexts that are reliably paired with drug use can renew extinguished drug-seeking behavior and amplify responding elicited by discrete, drug-predictive cues. Akin to drug-associated contexts, interoceptive drug stimuli produced by the psychopharmacological effects of drugs can also influence learning and memory processes that play a role in substance use disorders. Findings from human laboratory studies show that drug-associated contexts, including social stimuli, can have profound effects on cue reactivity, drug use, and drug-related cognitive expectancies. This translationally relevant research supports the idea that treatments for substance use disorders could be improved by considering drug-associated contexts as a factor in treatment interventions. We conclude this review with ideas for how to integrate drug-associated contexts into treatment-oriented research based on 4 approaches: pharmacology, brain stimulation, mindfulness-based relapse prevention, and cognitive behavioral group therapy. Throughout, we focus on alcohol- and tobacco-related research, which are two of the most prevalent and commonly misused drugs worldwide for which there are known treatments.;,citation_author=Mandy Rita LeCocq;,citation_author=Patrick A.

However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.;,citation_author=Scott M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Treating alcoholism as a chronic disease: Approaches to long-term continuing care;,citation_abstract=For many patients, alcohol and other drug (AOD) use disorders are chronic, recurring conditions involving multiple cycles of treatment, abstinence, and relapse. To disrupt this cycle, treatment can include continuing care to reduce the risk of relapse. The most commonly used treatment approach is initial intensive inpatient or outpatient care based on 12-step principles, followed by continuing care involving self-help groups, 12-step group counseling, or individual therapy. Although these programs can be effective, many patients drop out of initial treatment or do not complete continuing care. Thus, researchers and clinicians have begun to develop alternative approaches to enhance treatment retention in both initial and continuing care. One focus of these efforts has been the design of extended treatment models. These approaches increasingly blur the distinction between initial and continuing care and aim to prolong treatment participation by providing a continuum of care. Other researchers have focused on developing alternative treatment strategies (e.g., telephone-based interventions) that go beyond traditional settings and adaptive treatment algorithms that may improve outcomes for clients who do not respond well to traditional approaches.;,citation_author=James R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The persistence of maladaptive memory: Addiction, drug memories and anti-relapse treatments;,citation_abstract=Addiction is a chronic, relapsing disorder, characterised by the long-term propensity of addicted individuals to relapse. A major factor that obstructs the attainment of abstinence is the persistence of maladaptive drug-associated memories, which can maintain drug-seeking and taking behaviour and promote unconscious relapse of these habits. Thus, addiction can be conceptualised as a disorder of aberrant learning of the formation of strong instrumental memories linking actions to drug-seeking and taking outcomes that ultimately are expressed as persistent stimulus-response habits; of previously neutral environmental stimuli that become associated with drug highs (and/or withdrawal states) through pavlovian conditioning, and of the subsequent interactions between pavlovian and instrumental memories to influence relapse behaviour. Understanding the psychological, neurobiological and molecular basis of these drug memories may produce new methods of pro-abstinence, anti-relapse treatments for addiction.;,citation_author=Amy L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Rates and predictors of relapse after natural and treated remission from alcohol use disorders;,citation_abstract=AIMS: This study examined the rates and predictors of 3-year remission, and subsequent 16-year relapse, among initially untreated individuals with alcohol use disorders who did not obtain help or who participated in treatment and/or Alcoholics Anonymous in the first year after recognizing their need for help. DESIGN AND MEASURES: A sample of individuals (n = 461) who initiated help-seeking was surveyed at baseline and 1 year, 3 years, 8 years and 16 years later. Participants provided information on their life history of drinking, alcohol-related functioning and life context and coping. FINDINGS: Compared to individuals who obtained help, those who did not were less likely to achieve 3-year remission and subsequently were more likely to relapse. Less alcohol consumption and fewer drinking problems, more self-efficacy and less reliance on avoidance coping at baseline predicted 3-year remission; this was especially true of individuals who remitted without help. Among individuals who were remitted at 3 years, those who consumed more alcohol but were less likely to see their drinking as a significant problem, had less self-efficacy, and relied more on avoidance coping, were more likely to relapse by 16 years. These findings held for individuals who initially obtained help and for those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: Natural remission may be followed by a high likelihood of relapse; thus, preventive interventions may be indicated to forestall future alcohol problems among individuals who cut down temporarily on drinking on their own.;,citation_author=Rudolf H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Predicting Depression in Adolescents Using Mobile and Wearable Sensors: Multimodal Machine LearningâBased Exploratory Study;,citation_abstract=Background Depression levels in adolescents have trended upward over the past several years. According to a 2020 survey by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 4.1 million US adolescents have experienced at least one major depressive episode. This number constitutes approximately 16% of adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. However, only 32.3% of adolescents received some form of specialized or nonspecialized treatment. Identifying worsening symptoms earlier using mobile and wearable sensors may lead to earlier intervention. Most studies on predicting depression using sensor-based data are geared toward the adult population. Very few studies look into predicting depression in adolescents. Objective The aim of our work was to study passively sensed data from adolescents with depression and investigate the predictive capabilities of 2 machine learning approaches to predict depression scores and change in depression levels in adolescents. This work also provided an in-depth analysis of sensor features that serve as key indicators of change in depressive symptoms and the effect of variation of data samples on model accuracy levels. Methods This study included 55 adolescents with symptoms of depression aged 12 to 17 years. Each participant was passively monitored through smartphone sensors and Fitbit wearable devices for 24 weeks. Passive sensors collected call, conversation, location, and heart rate information daily. Following data preprocessing, 67% (37/55) of the participants in the aggregated data set were analyzed. Weekly Patient Health Questionnaire-9 surveys answered by participants served as the ground truth. We applied regression-based approaches to predict the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 depression score and change in depression severity. These approaches were consolidated using universal and personalized modeling strategies. The universal strategies consisted of Leave One Participant Out and Leave Week X Out. The personalized strategy models were based on Accumulated Weeks and Leave One Week One User Instance Out. Linear and nonlinear machine learning algorithms were trained to model the data. Results We observed that personalized approaches performed better on adolescent depression prediction compared with universal approaches. The best models were able to predict depression score and weekly change in depression level with root mean squared errors of 2.83 and 3.21, respectively, following the Accumulated Weeks personalized modeling strategy. Our feature importance investigation showed that the contribution of screen-, call-, and location-based features influenced optimal models and were predictive of adolescent depression. Conclusions This study provides insight into the feasibility of using passively sensed data for predicting adolescent depression. We demonstrated prediction capabilities in terms of depression score and change in depression level. The prediction results revealed that personalized models performed better on adolescents than universal approaches. Feature importance provided a better understanding of depression and sensor data.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Context-Sensing Mobile Phone App (Q Sense) for Smoking Cessation: A Mixed-Methods Study;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: A major cause of lapse and relapse to smoking during a quit attempt is craving triggered by cues from a smokerâs immediate environment. To help smokers address these cue-induced cravings when attempting to quit, we have developed a context-aware smoking cessation app, Q Sense, which uses a smoking episode-reporting system combined with location sensing and geofencing to tailor support content and trigger support delivery in real time. OBJECTIVE: We sought to (1) assess smokersâ compliance with reporting their smoking in real time and identify reasons for noncompliance, (2) assess the appâs accuracy in identifying user-specific high-risk locations for smoking, (3) explore the feasibility and user perspective of geofence-triggered support, and (4) identify any technological issues or privacy concerns. METHODS: An explanatory sequential mixed-methods design was used, where data collected by the app informed semistructured interviews. Participants were smokers who owned an Android mobile phone and were willing to set a quit date within one month (N=15). App data included smoking reports with context information and geolocation, end-of-day (EoD) surveys of smoking beliefs and behavior, support message ratings, and app interaction data. Interviews were undertaken and analyzed thematically (N=13). Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed separately and findings presented sequentially. RESULTS: Out of 15 participants, 3 (20%) discontinued use of the app prematurely. Pre-quit date, the mean number of smoking reports received was 37.8 (SD 21.2) per participant, or 2.0 (SD 2.2) per day per participant. EoD surveys indicated that participants underreported smoking on at least 56.2% of days. Geolocation was collected in 97.0% of smoking reports with a mean accuracy of 31.6 (SD 16.8) meters. A total of 5 out of 9 (56%) eligible participants received geofence-triggered support. Interaction data indicated that 50.0% (137/274) of geofence-triggered message notifications were tapped within 30 minutes of being generated, resulting in delivery of a support message, and 78.2% (158/202) of delivered messages were rated by participants. Qualitative findings identified multiple reasons for noncompliance in reporting smoking, most notably due to environmental constraints and forgetting. Participants verified the appâs identification of their smoking locations, were largely positive about the value of geofence-triggered support, and had no privacy concerns about the data collected by the app. CONCLUSIONS: User-initiated self-report is feasible for training a cessation app about an individualâs smoking behavior, although underreporting is likely. Geofencing was a reliable and accurate method of identifying smoking locations, and geofence-triggered support was regarded positively by participants.;,citation_author=Felix Naughton;,citation_author=Sarah Hopewell;,citation_author=Neal Lathia;,citation_author=Rik Schalbroeck;,citation_author=ChloÃ« Brown;,citation_author=Cecilia Mascolo;,citation_author=Andy McEwen;,citation_author=Stephen Sutton;,citation_publication_date=2016-09-16;,citation_cover_date=2016-09-16;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.2196/mhealth.5787;,citation_issn=2291-5222;,citation_volume=4;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=JMIR mHealth and uHealth;,citation_journal_abbrev=JMIR Mhealth Uhealth;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Fairness in Mobile PhoneâBased Mental Health Assessment Algorithms: Exploratory Study;,citation_abstract=Background Approximately 1 in 5 American adults experience mental illness every year. Thus, mobile phoneâbased mental health prediction apps that use phone data and artificial intelligence techniques for mental health assessment have become increasingly important and are being rapidly developed. At the same time, multiple artificial intelligenceârelated technologies (eg, face recognition and search results) have recently been reported to be biased regarding age, gender, and race. This study moves this discussion to a new domain: phone-based mental health assessment algorithms. It is important to ensure that such algorithms do not contribute to gender disparities through biased predictions across gender groups. Objective This research aimed to analyze the susceptibility of multiple commonly used machine learning approaches for gender bias in mobile mental health assessment and explore the use of an algorithmic disparate impact remover (DIR) approach to reduce bias levels while maintaining high accuracy. Methods First, we performed preprocessing and model training using the data set (N=55) obtained from a previous study. Accuracy levels and differences in accuracy across genders were computed using 5 different machine learning models. We selected the random forest model, which yielded the highest accuracy, for a more detailed audit and computed multiple metrics that are commonly used for fairness in the machine learning literature. Finally, we applied the DIR approach to reduce bias in the mental health assessment algorithm. Results The highest observed accuracy for the mental health assessment was 78.57%. Although this accuracy level raises optimism, the audit based on gender revealed that the performance of the algorithm was statistically significantly different between the male and female groups (eg, difference in accuracy across genders was 15.85%; P&amp;amp;amp;lt;.001). Similar trends were obtained for other fairness metrics. This disparity in performance was found to reduce significantly after the application of the DIR approach by adapting the data used for modeling (eg, the difference in accuracy across genders was 1.66%, and the reduction is statistically significant with P&amp;lt;.001). Conclusions This study grounds the need for algorithmic auditing in phone-based mental health assessment algorithms and the use of gender as a protected attribute to study fairness in such settings. Such audits and remedial steps are the building blocks for the widespread adoption of fair and accurate mental health assessment algorithms in the future.;,citation_author=Jinkyung Park;,citation_author=Ramanathan Arunachalam;,citation_author=Vincent Silenzio;,citation_author=Vivek K Singh;,citation_publication_date=2022-06-14;,citation_cover_date=2022-06-14;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://formative.jmir.org/2022/6/e34366;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.2196/34366;,citation_issn=2561-326X;,citation_volume=6;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=JMIR Formative Research;,citation_journal_abbrev=JMIR Form Res;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Defining equity in health;,citation_abstract=Study objective: To propose a definition of health equity to guide operationalisation and measurement, and to discuss the practical importance of clarity in defining this concept. Design: Conceptual discussion. Setting, Patients/Participants, and Main results: not applicable. Conclusions: For the purposes of measurement and operationalisation, equity in health is the absence of systematic disparities in health (or in the major social determinants of health) between groups with different levels of underlying social advantage/disadvantageâthat is, wealth, power, or prestige. Inequities in health systematically put groups of people who are already socially disadvantaged (for example, by virtue of being poor, female, and/or members of a disenfranchised racial, ethnic, or religious group) at further disadvantage with respect to their health; health is essential to wellbeing and to overcoming other effects of social disadvantage. Equity is an ethical principle; it also is consonant with and closely related to human rights principles. The proposed definition of equity supports operationalisation of the right to the highest attainable standard of health as indicated by the health status of the most socially advantaged group. Assessing health equity requires comparing health and its social determinants between more and less advantaged social groups. These comparisons are essential to assess whether national and international policies are leading toward or away from greater social justice in health.;,citation_author=P Braveman;,citation_author=S Gruskin;,citation_publication_date=2003-04-01;,citation_cover_date=2003-04-01;,citation_year=2003;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://jech.bmj.com/content/57/4/254.abstract;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1136/jech.57.4.254;,citation_volume=57;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health;,citation_journal_abbrev=J Epidemiol Community Health;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Ensuring Fairness in Machine Learning to Advance Health Equity;,citation_abstract=Machine learning is used increasingly in clinical care to improve diagnosis, treatment selection, and health system efficiency. Because machine-learning models learn from historically collected data, populations that have experienced human and structural biases in the past-called protected groups-are vulnerable to harm by incorrect predictions or withholding of resources. This article describes how model design, biases in data, and the interactions of model predictions with clinicians and patients may exacerbate health care disparities. Rather than simply guarding against these harms passively, machine-learning systems should be used proactively to advance health equity. For that goal to be achieved, principles of distributive justice must be incorporated into model design, deployment, and evaluation. The article describes several technical implementations of distributive justice-specifically those that ensure equality in patient outcomes, performance, and resource allocation-and guides clinicians as to when they should prioritize each principle.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Geolocation as a Digital Phenotyping Measure of Negative Symptoms and Functional Outcome;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE: Negative symptoms and functional outcome have traditionally been assessed using clinical rating scales, which rely on retrospective self-reports and have several inherent limitations that impact validity. These issues may be addressed with more objective digital phenotyping measures. In the current study, we evaluated the psychometric properties of a novel &amp;amp;amp;quot;passive&amp;quot; digital phenotyping method: geolocation. METHOD: Participants included outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (SZ: n = 44), outpatients with bipolar disorder (BD: n =19), and demographically matched healthy controls (CN: n = 42) who completed 6 days of &quot;active&quot; digital phenotyping assessments (eg, surveys) while geolocation was recorded. RESULTS: Results indicated that SZ patients show less activity than CN and BD, particularly, in their travel from home. Geolocation variables demonstrated convergent validity by small to medium correlations with negative symptoms and functional outcome measured via clinical rating scales, as well as active digital phenotyping behavioral indices of avolition, asociality, and anhedonia. Discriminant validity was supported by low correlations with positive symptoms, depression, and anxiety. Reliability was supported by good internal consistency and moderate stability across days. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide preliminary support for the reliability and validity of geolocation as an objective measure of negative symptoms and functional outcome. Geolocation offers enhanced precision and the ability to take a &quot;big data&quot; approach that facilitates sophisticated computational models. Near-continuous recordings and large numbers of samples may make geolocation a novel outcome measure for clinical trials due to enhanced power to detect treatment effects.;,citation_author=Ian M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Structural racism in the built environment: Segregation and the overconcentration of alcohol outlets;,citation_abstract=Structural racism, evidenced in practices like residential racial segregation, has been linked to health inequities. We examined the relationship between an adverse environmental factor (alcohol outlet overconcentration), segregated neighborhoods, and county alcohol policy in Louisiana and Alabama to investigate this link. Multilevel analysis revealed high outlet density associated with segregated counties and predominantly black census tracts in counties with restrictive alcohol policy. This inverse association between policies designed to limit alcohol availability and overconcentration of outlets in black neighborhoods warrants consideration by policymakers given links between outlet density and health inequities. Consideration of these findings in historical context suggests these policies may function as a contemporary actualization of the historical use of alcohol policy to subjugate black people in the South, now over-concentrating instead of prohibiting access.;,citation_author=Jennifer Scott;,citation_author=Denise Danos;,citation_author=Robert Collins;,citation_author=Neal Simonsen;,citation_author=Claudia Leonardi;,citation_author=Richard Scribner;,citation_author=Denise Herd;,citation_publication_date=2020-07;,citation_cover_date=2020-07;,citation_year=2020;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.healthplace.2020.102385;,citation_issn=1873-2054;,citation_volume=64;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Health &amp;amp;amp; Place;,citation_journal_abbrev=Health Place;">

With the development of technology, objective measurement for behavior and functional indicators of depression has become possible through the passive sensing technology of digital devices.

Location data demonstrated promising predictive power for depression. Studies examining the relationship between individual location data variables and depression, homestay, entropy, and the normalized entropy variable of entropy dimension showed the most consistent and significant correlations. Furthermore, variables of distance, irregularity, and location showed significant associations in some studies. However, semantic location showed inconsistent results. This suggests that the process of geographical movement is more related to mood changes than to semantic location.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Review. Psychological and neural mechanisms of relapse;,citation_abstract=Relapse, the resumption of drug taking after periods of abstinence, remains the major problem for the treatment of addiction. Even when drugs are unavailable for long periods or when users are successful in curbing their drug use for extended periods, individuals remain vulnerable to events that precipitate relapse. Behavioural studies in humans and laboratory animals show that drug-related stimuli, drugs themselves and stressors are powerful events for the precipitation of relapse. Molecular, neurochemical and anatomical studies have identified lasting neural changes that arise from mere exposure to drugs and other enduring changes that arise from learning about the relationship between drug-related stimuli and drug effects. Chronic drug exposure increases sensitivity of some systems of the brain to the effects of drugs and stressful events. These changes, combined with those underlying conditioning and learning, perpetuate vulnerability to drug-related stimuli. Circuits of the brain involved are those of the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system and its glutamatergic connections, and the corticotropin-releasing factor and noradrenergic systems of the limbic brain. This paper reviews advances in our understanding of how these systems mediate the effects of events that precipitate relapse and of how lasting changes in these systems can perpetuate vulnerability to relapse.;,citation_author=Jane Stewart;,citation_publication_date=2008-10-12;,citation_cover_date=2008-10-12;,citation_year=2008;,citation_issue=1507;,citation_doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0084;,citation_issn=1471-2970;,citation_volume=363;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A systematic review of smartphone-based human activity recognition methods for health research;,citation_abstract=Abstract Smartphones are now nearly ubiquitous; their numerous built-in sensors enable continuous measurement of activities of daily living, making them especially well-suited for health research. Researchers have proposed various human activity recognition (HAR) systems aimed at translating measurements from smartphones into various types of physical activity. In this review, we summarized the existing approaches to smartphone-based HAR. For this purpose, we systematically searched Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science for peer-reviewed articles published up to December 2020 on the use of smartphones for HAR. We extracted information on smartphone body location, sensors, and physical activity types studied and the data transformation techniques and classification schemes used for activity recognition. Consequently, we identified 108 articles and described the various approaches used for data acquisition, data preprocessing, feature extraction, and activity classification, identifying the most common practices, and their alternatives. We conclude that smartphones are well-suited for HAR research in the health sciences. For population-level impact, future studies should focus on improving the quality of collected data, address missing data, incorporate more diverse participants and activities, relax requirements about phone placement, provide more complete documentation on study participants, and share the source code of the implemented methods and algorithms.;,citation_author=Marcin Straczkiewicz;,citation_author=Peter James;,citation_author=Jukka-Pekka Onnela;,citation_publication_date=2021-10-18;,citation_cover_date=2021-10-18;,citation_year=2021;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00514-4;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1038/s41746-021-00514-4;,citation_issn=2398-6352;,citation_volume=4;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=npj Digital Medicine;,citation_journal_abbrev=npj Digit.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Drinking, Alcohol Use Disorder, and Treatment Access and Utilization Among U.S. Racial/Ethnic Groups;,citation_abstract=Data from approximately 140 articles and reports published since 2000 on drinking, alcohol use disorder ( AUD ), correlates of drinking and AUD , and treatment needs, access, and utilization were critically examined and summarized. Epidemiological evidence demonstrates alcoholârelated disparities across U.S. racial/ethnic groups. American Indians/Alaska Natives generally drink more and are disproportionately affected by alcohol problems, having some of the highest rates for AUD . In contrast, Asian Americans are less affected. Differences across Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics are more nuanced. The diversity in drinking and problem rates that is observed across groups also exists within groups, particularly among Hispanics, Asian Americans, and American Indians/Alaska Natives. Research findings also suggest that acculturation to the United States and nativity affect drinking. Recent studies on ethnic drinking cultures uncover the possible influence that native countriesâ cultural norms around consumption still have on immigrantsâ alcohol use. The reasons for racial/ethnic disparities in drinking and AUD are complex and are associated with historically rooted patterns of racial discrimination and persistent socioeconomic disadvantage. This disadvantage is present at both individual and environmental levels. Finally, these data indicate that admission to alcohol treatment is also complex and is dependent on the presence and severity of alcohol problems but also on a variety of other factors. These include individualsâ sociodemographic characteristics, the availability of appropriate services, factors that may trigger coercion into treatment by family, friends, employers, and the legal system, and the overall organization of the treatment system. More research is needed to understand facilitators and barriers to treatment to improve access to services and support.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The role of daily mobility in mental health inequalities: The interactive influence of activity space and neighbourhood of residence on depression;,citation_abstract=The literature reports an association between neighbourhood deprivation and individual depression after adjustment for individual factors. The present paper investigates whether vulnerability to neighbourhood features is influenced by individual &amp;amp;amp;quot;activity space&amp;quot; (i.e., the space within which people move about or travel in the course of their daily activities). It can be assumed that a deprived residential environment can exert a stronger influence on the mental health of people whose activity space is limited to their neighbourhood of residence, since their exposure to their neighbourhood would be greater. Moreover, we studied the relationship between activity space size and depression. A limited activity space could indeed reflect spatial and social confinement and thus be associated with a higher risk of being depressed, or, conversely, it could be linked to a deep attachment to the neighbourhood of residence and thus be associated with a lower risk of being depressed. Multilevel logistic regression analyses of a representative sample consisting of 3011 inhabitants surveyed in 2005 in the Paris, France metropolitan area and nested within 50 census blocks showed, after adjusting for individual-level variables, that people living in deprived neighbourhoods were significantly more depressed that those living in more advantaged neighbourhoods. We also observed a statistically significant cross-level interaction between activity space and neighbourhood deprivation, as they relate to depression. Living in a deprived neighbourhood had a stronger and statistically significant effect on depression in people whose activity space was limited to their neighbourhood than in those whose daily travels extended beyond it. In addition, a limited activity space appeared to be a protective factor with regard to depression for people living in advantaged neighbourhoods and a risk factor for those living in deprived neighbourhoods. It could therefore be useful to take activity space into consideration more often when studying the social and spatial determinants of depression.;,citation_author=Julie VallÃ©e;,citation_author=Emmanuelle Cadot;,citation_author=Christelle Roustit;,citation_author=Isabelle Parizot;,citation_author=Pierre Chauvin;,citation_publication_date=2011-10;,citation_cover_date=2011-10;,citation_year=2011;,citation_issue=8;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.08.009;,citation_issn=1873-5347;,citation_volume=73;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Social Science &amp;amp; Medicine (1982);,citation_journal_abbrev=Soc Sci Med;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol-seeking and relapse: A focus on incentive salience and contextual conditioning;,citation_abstract=Environmental stimuli that reliably accompany alcohol intake can become associated with the pharmacological effects of alcohol through classical (Pavlovian) conditioning. Of growing interest to addiction researchers is whether or not this process results in the attribution of incentive salience to alcohol-predictive cues, which could motivate alcohol-seeking behavior and relapse. To evaluate this question, we present a review of rodent behavioral studies that examined the capacity of alcohol-predictive cues to (i) support sign-tracking behavior, (ii) serve as conditioned reinforcers, and (iii) produce Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer. A second, emerging area of research is focused on delineating the role of context in alcohol-seeking behavior and relapse. Here, we review studies showing that alcohol-associated contexts (i) support conditioned place preference, (ii) renew extinguished alcohol-seeking behavior, and (iii) modulate alcohol-seeking responses elicited by discrete alcohol-predictive cues. These behavioral effects may be mediated by unique psychological processes, and have important implications for cue-reactivity studies and neurobiological research.;,citation_author=Milan D.

Individual factors (coping, self-efficacy, resource needs, and expectations for sober fun), social/environmental factors (craving, exposure, negative social influences, and involvement in substance-using leisure activities), and background characteristics measured during treatment were used to predict alcohol and drug use during a 2-year follow-up using manifest variable regression analysis. Results suggest that poorer self-efficacy, greater involvement in substance-using leisure activities, being single, and less income predicted alcohol use directly, whereas greater resource needs and involvement in substance-using leisure activities, being of minority status, and being single predicted drug use directly. Income, gender, problem severity, marital status, and race also predicted alcohol and drug use indirectly.

These three setting attributes were assessed in their home, work, and community settings. Reuse was assessed 3 months later. When controlling for confounding variables, aspects of the home settings significantly distinguished abstainers from reusers; perceived risk for relapse was the strongest predictor of reuse. Exposure to substances and involvement in reinforcing activities were not robust reuse indicators. The work and community settings were not significant determinants of reuse.

However, the use of algorithms for automated decision-making can cause unintentional biases that lead to discrimination against certain specific groups. In this context, it is crucial to develop machine learning algorithms that are not only accurate but also fair. There is an extensive discussion of algorithmic fairness in the existing literature. Many scholars have proposed and tested definitions of fairness and attempted to address the problem of unfairness or discrimination in algorithms. This review aims to outline different definitions of algorithmic fairness and to introduce the procedure for constructing fair algorithms to enhance fairness in machine learning. First, this review divides the definitions of algorithmic fairness into two categories, namely, awareness-based fairness and rationality-based fairness, and discusses existing representative algorithmic fairness concepts and notions based on the two categories. Then, metrics for unfairness/discrimination identification are summarized and different unfairness/discrimination removal approaches are discussed to facilitate a better understanding of how algorithmic fairness can be implemented in different scenarios.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Machine learning models for temporally precise lapse prediction in alcohol use disorder;,citation_abstract=We developed three separate models that provide hour-by-hour probabilities of a future lapse back to alcohol use with increasing temporal precision (i.e., lapses in the next week, next day, and next hour). Model features were based on raw scores and longitudinal change in theoretically implicated risk factors collected through ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Participants (N=151; 51% male; mean age = 41; 87% White, 97% Non-Hispanic) in early recovery (1â8 weeks of abstinence) from alcohol use disorder provided 4x daily EMA for up to three months. We used grouped, nested cross-validation, with 1 repeat of 10-fold cross-validation for the inner loop and 3 repeats of 10-fold cross-validation for the outer loop to train models, select best models, and evaluate those best models on auROC. Models yielded median areas under the receiver operating curves (auROCs) of .90, .91, and .94 in the 30 held-out test sets for week, day, and hour level models, respectively. Some feature categories consistently emerged as being globally important to lapse prediction across our week, day, and hour level models (i.e., past use, future efficacy). However, most of the more punctuate, time varying constructs (e.g., craving, past stressful events, arousal) appear to have greater impact within the next hour prediction model.

<section id="specific-aims" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="specific-aims">Specific Aims</h2>
<p>Smart digital therapeutics (âsmart DTxâ) refer to treatments delivered via technology such as smartphones that use machine learning algorithms to recommend engagement with particular in-app modules at the optimal time. In the context of alcohol use disorder (AUD), these algorithms could be used 1) to predict an oncoming lapse; and 2) to encourage use of specific tools to minimize risk of that lapse occurring based on factors specifically relevant to that individual (e.g., changes in mood, difficulty with close social connections, proximity to triggering locations). In other words, these algorithms have the potential to predict both <em>when</em> and <em>why</em> a lapse may occur. This is beneficial with respect to AUD where it may be difficult for an individual to know the exact precipitants to a lapse, even if the lapse itself is anticipated. These algorithms not only need to be developed outright, but also need to perform well (i.e., pinpoint lapses accurately) and identify meaningful, actionable lapse precursors. However, before accurate personalized recommendations can be offered, smart DTx must demonstrate similar performance across sub-groups and provide a sustainable method of data collection for users (i.e., minimally burdensome).</p>
<p>A fair algorithm is one with no preference in performance with respect to inherent or acquired characteristics (e.g., gender, race, socioeconomic status) <span class="citation" data-cites="wangBriefReviewAlgorithmic2022">(<a href="#ref-wangBriefReviewAlgorithmic2022" role="doc-biblioref">Wang, Zhang, and Zhu 2022</a>)</span>. In the context of AUD, this would mean that lapse predictions are reasonably accurate and do not favor or disadvantage any particular group. The performance of an algorithm across sub-groups can be assessed using measures of <em>algorithmic fairness</em>, which quantify relative differences in predictions like accuracy. Incorrect predictions of lapse (or lack thereof) could result in both poorer outcomes and eroded trust of these tools. Assessing algorithmic fairness during the development of smart DTx seeks to ensure that the same standard of care is provided to everyone utilizing it.</p>
<p>The inputs to these algorithms are also important to consider. For example, many DTx use self-report measures administered several times per day (ecological momentary assessment or âEMAâ). However, EMA may be burdensome for individuals who do not have the flexibility of filling out repeated assessments each day. One solution is to utilize data collected via unobtrusive means, like geolocation data, which captures facets of activity patterns such as movement, frequency, duration, and time. Smartphones come pre-equipped with sensors to be able to capture this granular data continuously. Furthermore, geolocation requires little maintenance following initial set-up. Minimal additional contextual data can also be solicited from individuals about frequently visited locations to distill targets for intervention. A smart DTx could take these salient features and identify helpful in-app modules accordingly. Taken together, supplemented geolocation data can provide insight into how activity patterns and location semantics interface to increase (or decrease) the probability of lapse.</p>
<p>For my first-year project, I intend to use geolocation data collected from smartphones and corresponding self-reported contextual information for frequently visited locations to build a machine learning algorithm to predict next-day alcohol use lapse among participants with a diagnosis of AUD and a recovery goal of abstinence. I will also evaluate the algorithmic fairness of the model using both algorithmic fairness metrics for discrete subgroups and statistical modeling that accounts for cross-group membership (i.e., a more intersectional approach).</p>
<p>To accomplish these goals, I have identified the following specific aims:</p>
<p><strong>Aim 1: Train several machine learning algorithms to predict alcohol lapse from geolocation data.</strong> Features will be derived from continuous geolocation data in combination with contextual information about frequently visited (&gt;2 per one month period) locations. Several candidate classification algorithms will be trained and evaluated to predict next-day lapse.</p>
<p><strong>Aim 2: Evaluate the best performing algorithm.</strong> Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (auROC) will be used as the primary performance metric to select and evaluate algorithm configurations. Secondary performance metrics (e.g., sensitivity, specificity) and interpretability metrics (i.e., SHAP values) will also be used to evaluate algorithms.</p>
<p><strong>Aim 3: Evaluate the algorithmic fairness of the top performing algorithm across subgroups who experience known treatment disparities in the context of AUD.</strong> Algorithmic fairness will be examined across ârace/ethnicity, marital status, education, and sexâ. Fairness will be evaluated using metrics calculated across discrete subgroups.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="significance">Significance</h2>
<p>Chronic, recurrent patterns of relapse back to harmful alcohol use are, for many individuals with AUD, a common occurrence during the recovery process <span class="citation" data-cites="mckayTreatingAlcoholismChronic2011a moosRatesPredictorsRelapse2006">(<a href="#ref-mckayTreatingAlcoholismChronic2011a" role="doc-biblioref">McKay and Hiller-Sturmhofel 2011</a>; <a href="#ref-moosRatesPredictorsRelapse2006" role="doc-biblioref">Moos and Moos 2006</a>)</span>. Lapses, or single instances of goal-inconsistent use that may lead to relapse, are therefore an important intervention target <span class="citation" data-cites="witkiewitzRelapsePreventionAlcohol2004a">(<a href="#ref-witkiewitzRelapsePreventionAlcohol2004a" role="doc-biblioref">Witkiewitz and Marlatt 2004</a>)</span>. However, the factors that may precipitate a lapse change both person-by-person and moment-by-moment, highlighting the potential utility of smart DTx in this space and, at a necessarily earlier step, the need for algorithm development to accurately predict these outcomes. Understanding not only when a lapse may happen, but also why, are both key components to facilitate optimally effective intervention. Because it is dynamic and continuous, measures which seek to quantify risk of lapse need to be able to keep up with appropriate levels of granularity.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-role-of-location-in-lapse">The role of location in lapse</h3>
<p>The importance of location, such as environmental cues or oneâs perceived riskiness of a setting, has been shown to play an important role in lapse <span class="citation" data-cites="janakPotentEffectEnvironmental2010 waltonIndividualSocialEnvironmental2003 waltonSocialSettingsAddiction1995">(<a href="#ref-janakPotentEffectEnvironmental2010" role="doc-biblioref">Janak and Chaudhri 2010</a>; <a href="#ref-waltonIndividualSocialEnvironmental2003" role="doc-biblioref">Maureen A. Walton et al. 2003</a>; <a href="#ref-waltonSocialSettingsAddiction1995" role="doc-biblioref">M. A. Walton, Reischl, and Ramanthan 1995</a>)</span>. This link with lapse risk has translated into the integration of coping skills relating to substance-associated contexts in several treatment strategies like mindfulness-based relapse prevention <span class="citation" data-cites="lecocqConsideringDrugAssociatedContexts2020">(<a href="#ref-lecocqConsideringDrugAssociatedContexts2020" role="doc-biblioref">LeCocq et al. 2020</a>)</span>. These findings underscore the potential wealth of information relating to lapse risk that an individualâs location can provide.</p>
<p>Some of the more nuanced facets captured within location are associations with others (or lack thereof, e.g., social isolation), associations with previous drinking behaviors (e.g., whether or not alcohol is present), and associations with affect (i.e., negative versus positive emotions tied to a given location). Moreover, these different factors may play differential roles in lapse risk across individuals. For example, for one person, spending time in locations associated with negative affect may be a strong trigger, whereas for another it may be a lack of contact with others. A key benefit to using location data to predict lapse is its ability to cast a wide net across potential triggers and, therefore, to be applicable to a wide range of people.</p>

<p>Geolocation data, also referred to as global positioning system (GPS) data, are data which quantify spatial positioning and movement across time. Many forms of technology that are now ubiquitous in daily life, such as smartphones and smartwatches, automatically and continually collect these data. This fact, paired with increasing rates of smartphone ownership, suggest that there is high potential for these data to be harnessed for mental health applications <span class="citation" data-cites="areanMobileTechnologyMental2016">(<a href="#ref-areanMobileTechnologyMental2016" role="doc-biblioref">AreÃ n, Hoa Ly, and Andersson 2016</a>)</span>. In the context of substance use, geolocation data has been specifically identified as being of particular use in both understanding the precipitants to harmful use and its effective treatment <span class="citation" data-cites="stahlerGeospatialTechnologyExposome2013">(<a href="#ref-stahlerGeospatialTechnologyExposome2013" role="doc-biblioref">Stahler, Mennis, and Baron 2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>While previous mental health research utilizing geolocation data has shown promise, the features used and outcomes explored have largely been siloed across psychopathology subfields. For example, within the substance use literature, geolocation data have historically been used to examine risky locations, such as the influence of neighborhood characteristics on use <span class="citation" data-cites="epsteinRealtimeTrackingNeighborhood2014a kwanUncertaintiesGeographicContext2019">(<a href="#ref-epsteinRealtimeTrackingNeighborhood2014a" role="doc-biblioref">Epstein et al. 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-kwanUncertaintiesGeographicContext2019" role="doc-biblioref">Kwan et al. 2019</a>)</span> and individual physical proximity to locations of potential or past harmful use such as bars (either estimated using geofencing or user-defined) <span class="citation" data-cites="attwoodUsingMobileHealth2017 carreiroRealizeAnalyzeEngage2021 gonzalezComparisonSmartphoneApp2015 gustafsonSmartphoneApplicationSupport2014a naughtonContextSensingMobilePhone2016">(<a href="#ref-attwoodUsingMobileHealth2017" role="doc-biblioref">Attwood et al. 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-carreiroRealizeAnalyzeEngage2021" role="doc-biblioref">Carreiro et al. 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-gonzalezComparisonSmartphoneApp2015" role="doc-biblioref">Gonzalez and Dulin 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-gustafsonSmartphoneApplicationSupport2014a" role="doc-biblioref">Gustafson et al. 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-naughtonContextSensingMobilePhone2016" role="doc-biblioref">Naughton et al. 2016</a>)</span>. Several of the applications implemented in these studies enable real-time notifications about locations to their users (e.g., âYou are entering a high-risk zoneâ).</p>
<p>On the other hand, contrary to the substance use literature, affective scientists have focused more on factors relating to mood and behavior. Geolocation data have been used to estimate loneliness and isolation <span class="citation" data-cites="doryabIdentifyingBehavioralPhenotypes2019a">(<a href="#ref-doryabIdentifyingBehavioralPhenotypes2019a" role="doc-biblioref">Doryab et al. 2019</a>)</span>, to demonstrate increases in positive affect from seeking out novel environments <span class="citation" data-cites="hellerAssociationRealworldExperiential2020">(@ <a href="#ref-hellerAssociationRealworldExperiential2020" role="doc-biblioref">Heller et al. 2020</a>)</span>, and to quantify depressive symptoms <span class="citation" data-cites="raughGeolocationDigitalPhenotyping2020">(<a href="#ref-raughGeolocationDigitalPhenotyping2020" role="doc-biblioref">Raugh et al. 2020</a>)</span>. Moreover, these data have not only been harnessed to measure mood symptoms but to also predict their emergence <span class="citation" data-cites="shinSystematicReviewLocation2023">(for review, see <a href="#ref-shinSystematicReviewLocation2023" role="doc-biblioref">Shin and Bae 2023</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Latent characteristics of location â such as isolation, mobility, novelty seeking, and the emotional valence â are notably lacking in the substance use geolocation literature, but have historically been captured in other ways such as by way of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data. In substance use research, EMA surveys often ask information about mood, social experiences, and daily activities. However, geolocation data provides greater temporal sensitivity and specificity compared to its EMA counterpart, which is collected at static intervals several times per day as opposed to the continuous sampling of geolocation data. While there is no doubt in the predictive utility of EMA measures in the context of lapse <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantMachineLearningModels2023a">(<a href="#ref-wyantMachineLearningModels2023a" role="doc-biblioref">Wyant et al. 2023</a>)</span>, the affective science literature suggests that it may be possible to quantify some of these features utilizing location data. In the context of a smart DTx, this would mean reduced patient burden (i.e., fewer surveys to fill out) and a potentially more equitable system (i.e., easier for people who canât fill out multiple surveys a day to engage with).</p>
<p>My first-year project will address a crucial gap in the literature between clinical science subdisciplines by applying feature engineering techniques both from the substance use and affective science literatures, therefore providing a novel, dynamic lens to the use of geolocation data in predicting lapse. Moreover, it will implement a lower burden, finer-grained temporal perspective compared to other techniques like EMA. Taking both of these limitations of previous work into account, my first-year project will develop a sensing system that can predict lapse day-to-day utilizing a broad range of low-burden features which capture facets of both movement and mood.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="algorithmic-fairness">Algorithmic fairness</h3>
<p>While a great strength of machine learning algorithms is their ability to elucidate latent statistical patterns of data, its greatest weakness lies in the necessary reliance on these data. In the context of health-related data, historical patterns of health care inequities will almost certainly and unavoidably be embedded within data used to train algorithms. These inequities may unintentionally be carried forward in perpetuity by machine learning models if not critically examined. Without examining algorithmic fairness prior to deployment in the real-world, smart DTx run the risk of providing sub-optimal mental health care to individuals who already face disadvantages.</p>
<p>Conversations around machine learning and fairness in healthcare have peppered the literature for several years <span class="citation" data-cites="rajkomarEnsuringFairnessMachine2018a wawiragichoyaEquityEssenceCall2021">(<a href="#ref-rajkomarEnsuringFairnessMachine2018a" role="doc-biblioref">Rajkomar et al. 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-wawiragichoyaEquityEssenceCall2021" role="doc-biblioref">Wawira Gichoya et al. 2021</a>)</span>, yet no concrete standards of reporting of algorithmic fairness have been delineated. This is of critical importance in considering that the ultimate goal of many of these algorithms is to be implemented in patient contexts. One potential legal marker of algorithmic fairness may be derived from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) 80% rule, which states that hiring rates of individuals from protected groups (e.g., people of color, women) should be at least 80% that of white men. Applied in the context of algorithmic fairness, this would be something like model performance being at least 80% of the best-performing group.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that standards of reporting do not exist, there are many established metrics for statistically assessing algorithmic fairness. Common metrics of algorithmic fairness are predicated on the assignment of a âprivilegedâ and ânon-privilegedâ group. Once this has been established, measures such as accuracy can be examined between those two groups <span class="citation" data-cites="wisniewskiFairmodelsFlexibleTool2022">(for example metrics, see: <a href="#ref-wisniewskiFairmodelsFlexibleTool2022" role="doc-biblioref">WiÅniewski and Biecek 2022</a>)</span>. This can be repeated over many combinations of privileged and non-privileged groups to assess model performance across various identities.</p>
<p>At broad level, algorithmic fairness is paramount to consider in context of AUD because risk, access to and engagement with treatment, and negative consequences from drinking vary across socioeconomic status, race, and gender in AUD <span class="citation" data-cites="callingSocioeconomicStatusAlcohol2019 vaethDrinkingAlcoholUse2017a witbrodtRacialEthnicDisparities2014">(<a href="#ref-callingSocioeconomicStatusAlcohol2019" role="doc-biblioref">Calling et al. 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-vaethDrinkingAlcoholUse2017a" role="doc-biblioref">Vaeth, WangâSchweig, and Caetano 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-witbrodtRacialEthnicDisparities2014" role="doc-biblioref">Witbrodt et al. 2014</a>)</span>. Location plays an important role in contributing to mental health inequities in general <span class="citation" data-cites="valleeRoleDailyMobility2011">(<a href="#ref-valleeRoleDailyMobility2011" role="doc-biblioref">VallÃ©e et al. 2011</a>)</span>, and in the context of substance use, exposure to substances, neighborhood disadvantage, and barriers to treatment stratified by location all contribute to the initiation and maintenance of SUDs <span class="citation" data-cites="mennisRiskySubstanceUse2016">(<a href="#ref-mennisRiskySubstanceUse2016" role="doc-biblioref">Mennis, Stahler, and Mason 2016</a>)</span>. Furthermore, these inequities are not shared equally across the population: for example, alcohol outlet density is greater in predominantly Black census tracts <span class="citation" data-cites="scottStructuralRacismBuilt2020">(<a href="#ref-scottStructuralRacismBuilt2020" role="doc-biblioref">Scott et al. 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>My first-year project will address several gaps in the mental health and algorithmic fairness literature. Firstly, it will advocate for the use of fairness metrics alongside other measures of algorithm performance. Secondly, it will apply measures to data which are known to contain these disparities in the context of substance use, geolocation data, in an effort to critically examine my best performing model.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="current-study">Current study</h3>
<p>My proposed first-year project will apply machine learning to predict lapse in AUD utilizing geolocation data. The first goal (<strong>Aims 1 and 2</strong>) is to build and evaluate a model to predict oncoming lapse with an almost entirely passive data stream for individuals with a recovery goal of abstinence. The second goal (<strong>Aim 3</strong>) is to critically examine the fairness of the best performing model.</p>

<section id="participants" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="participants">Participants</h3>
<p>One hundred and fifty one individuals in early-recovery (1-8 weeks of abstinence) for AUD were recruited from the Madison area to take part in a three-month study on how mobile health technology can provide recovery support. Recruitment approaches included social media platforms (e.g., Facebook), television and radio advertisements, and clinic referrals. Prospective participants completed a phone screen to assess match with eligibility criteria (Table 1). Participants were excluded if they exhibited severe symptoms of paranoia or psychosis (a score &lt;= 2.24 on the SCL-90 psychosis scale or a score &lt;= 2.82 on the SCL-90 paranoia scale administered at screening).</p>

<p>Participants enrolled in a three-month study consisting of five in-person visits, daily surveys, and continuous passive monitoring of geolocation data. Following screening and enrollment visits in which participants consented to participate, learned how to manage location sharing (i.e., turn off location sharing when desired), and reported frequently visited locations, participants completed three follow-up visits one month apart. At each visit, participants were asked questions about frequently visited (&gt;2 times during the course of the previous month) locations. Participants were debriefed at the third and final follow-up visit. Participants were expected to provide continuous geolocation data while on study. Other personal sensing data streams (EMA, cellular communications, sleep quality, and audio check-ins) were collected as part of the parent grantâs aims (R01 AA024391).</p>

<section id="definition-of-subgroups-for-fairness-assessments" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="definition-of-subgroups-for-fairness-assessments">Definition of subgroups for fairness assessments</h4>
<p>Subgroups will be defined on the basis of personal individual characteristics (in the machine learning fairness literature, âsensitive attributesâ) that are specifically associated with treatment disparities in AUD. Characteristics will be assessed using this method to ensure the development of a model that does not further exacerbate/magnify existing treatment disparities.</p>
</section>
<section id="lapses" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lapses">Lapses</h4>
<p>Alcohol lapses will be used as our outcome variable in this study and will be used to provide labels for model training, for testing model performance, and for testing issues of algorithmic fairness across our predefined subgroups. Future lapse occurrence (here conceptualized as next-day lapse) will be predicted in 24-hour rolling windows, beginning at midnight on a participantâs second day of participation to ensure one full day of data collection for the first window, and at every subsequent hour (i.e., future lapse in the next 24-hours predicted each hour). This rolling window approach will take advantage of the granular, continuous nature of geolocation data, enabling frequent updating of predictions. <em>Lapse</em> and <em>no lapse</em> occurrences will be identified from the daily survey question, âHave you drank any alcohol that you have not yet reported?â. Participants who responded <em>yes</em> to this question were then asked to report the date and hour of the start and the end of the drinking episode. In this case, the prediction window will be labeled <em>lapse</em>. Prediction windows will be labeled <em>no lapse</em> if no alcohol use was reported within that window. Windows will be excluded if no alcohol use occurred within the window but <em>did</em> occur within six hours of the start or end of the window for label fidelity.</p>

<section id="feature-engineering" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feature-engineering">Feature engineering</h3>
<p>Feature engineering is the process of creating variables (or âfeaturesâ) from unprocessed data and will be used in this project to transform raw data from three sources: 1) demographic characteristics relevant to treatment disparities in AUD collected at intake; 2) day at prediction window onset; and 3) geolocation data collected the prior day. Features will be created using all GPS features combined with demographic and day/time features.</p>
<p>We will generate a quantitative feature for age and dummy-coded features for race/ethnicity, marital status, education, and sex. Dummy-coded features indicating time of day (5pm - midnight versus any other time) and day of the week will also be generated. As a comparison to the geolocation model, a baseline model will also be developed utilizing only the time-of-day dummy-coded features to predict lapse. Features from geolocation data will be generated that both utilize contextual information collected from monthly surveys (i.e., location valence and perceived riskiness) as well as features that are independent of further individual input.</p>
<p>Features will be derived using examples from previous literature and will also be generated using contextual features. For example, geo-fencing techniques to identify bars and liquor stores <span class="citation" data-cites="gonzalezComparisonSmartphoneApp2015 gustafsonSmartphoneApplicationSupport2014a">(<a href="#ref-gonzalezComparisonSmartphoneApp2015" role="doc-biblioref">Gonzalez and Dulin 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-gustafsonSmartphoneApplicationSupport2014a" role="doc-biblioref">Gustafson et al. 2014</a>)</span> have been used in the AUD literature. More broadly, features such as isolation <span class="citation" data-cites="doryabIdentifyingBehavioralPhenotypes2019a raughGeolocationDigitalPhenotyping2020">(<a href="#ref-doryabIdentifyingBehavioralPhenotypes2019a" role="doc-biblioref">Doryab et al. 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-raughGeolocationDigitalPhenotyping2020" role="doc-biblioref">Raugh et al. 2020</a>)</span> and seeking of novelty locations <span class="citation" data-cites="hellerAssociationRealworldExperiential2020">(<a href="#ref-hellerAssociationRealworldExperiential2020" role="doc-biblioref">Heller et al. 2020</a>)</span> have been used in the affective science literature as mood proxies. In addition to the wide range of possible features from the literature, this data set affords the ability to create unique features using person-specific contextual information in tandem with geolocation data, such as places where an individual has drank in the past and the emotional valence associated with that location. We will also calculate raw and change features based on previous geolocation data in order to capture individual variation.</p>
<p>Imputation of missing data and removal of zero-variance features are additional general processing steps that will also be undertaken during feature engineering.</p>
</section>
<section id="algorithm-development-performance" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="algorithm-development-performance">Algorithm development &amp; performance</h3>
<p>The first aim of my project is to develop a machine learning model which can predict lapse from contextualized geolocation data. To accomplish this, first, several classification candidate machine learning algorithms will be considered and will be trained and assessed using participant-grouped, nested <em>k</em>-fold cross-validation. Grouped cross-validation assigns all data from a participant as either held-in or held-out to avoid bias introduced when predicting a participantâs data from their own data. Nested cross-validation uses two nested loops for dividing and holding out folds: an outer loop, where held-out folds serve as test sets for model evaluation; and inner loops, where held-out folds serve as validation sets for model selection. Importantly, these sets are independent, maintaining separation between data used to train the models, select the best models, and evaluate those best models. Therefore, nested cross-validation removes optimization bias from the evaluation of model performance in the test sets and can yield lower variance performance estimates than single test set approaches <span class="citation" data-cites="jonathanUseCrossvalidationAssess2000">(<a href="#ref-jonathanUseCrossvalidationAssess2000" role="doc-biblioref">Jonathan, Krzanowski, and McCarthy 2000</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The primary performance metric for model selection and evaluation will be area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (auROC) <span class="citation" data-cites="kuhnAppliedPredictiveModeling2018">(<a href="#ref-kuhnAppliedPredictiveModeling2018" role="doc-biblioref">Kuhn and Johnson 2018</a>)</span>. auROC indexes the probability that the model will predict a higher score for a randomly selected positive case (lapse) relative to a randomly selected negative case (no lapse). This metric was selected because it 1) combines sensitivity and specificity, which are both important characteristics for clinical implementation; 2) is an aggregate metric across all decision thresholds, which is important because optimal decision thresholds may differ across settings and goals; and 3) is unaffected by class imbalance, which is important for comparing models with differing prediction window widths and levels of class imbalance. The best model configuration will be selected using median auROC across all validation sets. Several secondary performance metrics including sensitivity, specificity, balanced accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) will also be assessed.</p>
<p>SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values will be computed as our interpretability metric to identify the relative importance of different features in each final algorithm. SHAP values measure the unique contribution of features in an algorithmâs predictions <span class="citation" data-cites="lundbergUnifiedApproachInterpreting2017">(<a href="#ref-lundbergUnifiedApproachInterpreting2017" role="doc-biblioref">Lundberg and Lee 2017</a>)</span>. SHAP values possess several useful properties including: Additivity (SHAP values for each feature can be computed independently and summed); Efficiency (the sum of SHAP values across features must add up to the difference between predicted and observed outcomes for each observation); Symmetry (SHAP values for two features should be equal if the two features contribute equally to all possible coalitions); and Dummy (a feature that does not change the predicted value in any coalition will have a SHAP value of 0). Highly important features represent relevant, actionable potential antecedents to lapse (and therefore points of intervention) that will be relevant in the future development of a smart DTx. However, these will be descriptive analyses because standard errors or other indices of uncertainty for importance scores are not available for SHAP values.</p>
<p>Finally, a Bayesian hierarchical generalized linear model will be used to estimate the posterior probability distributions and 95% Bayesian confidence intervals (CIs) for auROC between the baseline (time-of-day) and geolocation models.</p>
</section>
<section id="algorithmic-fairness-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="algorithmic-fairness-1">Algorithmic fairness</h3>
<p>The second aim of my project will be to assess the algorithmic fairness of the best-performing model. Several fairness metrics will be assessed across demographic characteristics implicated in treatment disparities, such as the true positive rate (TPR), true negative rate (TNR), and accuracy. These metrics can be calculated using a number of open source R packages <span class="citation" data-cites="wisniewskiFairmodelsFlexibleTool2022">(for example, <a href="#ref-wisniewskiFairmodelsFlexibleTool2022" role="doc-biblioref">WiÅniewski and Biecek 2022</a>)</span>. Differences in classification are calculated by first splitting the sample by group, where one is the privileged group and the other is the unprivileged group, and then examining assigned outcomes (in this case, <em>lapse</em> or <em>no lapse</em>). Additionally, I propose to conduct further analyses in order to assess algorithmic fairness taking into account the intersection of multiple identities when examining model performance <span class="citation" data-cites="fouldsIntersectionalDefinitionFairness2020">(e.g., <a href="#ref-fouldsIntersectionalDefinitionFairness2020" role="doc-biblioref">Foulds et al. 2020</a>)</span>. A Bayesian hierarchical generalized linear model will be used to estimate the posterior probability distributions and 95% Bayesian CIs for auROC across different subgroups.</p>
</section>
<section id="contribution-to-theory" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="contribution-to-theory">Contribution to Theory</h3>
<p>If successful, this study will contribute both to our ability to predict, and therefore our understanding of, lapse in AUD as well as how we approach designing equitable machine learning models. First, it will identify the most predictive features from a minimally burdensome and continuously collected data source, geolocation data. These features will be created leveraging modeling techniques from both the substance use and affective science subdisciplines, resulting in broadly relevant transdiagnostic constructs. Furthermore, this study will also provide a critical evaluation of model performance beyond AUC by including examination of algorithmic fairness. Though many fairness metrics have been used in simulated data or in publicly available data sets (e.g., <em>COMPAS</em> recidivism data set; <span class="citation" data-cites="dresselAccuracyFairnessLimits2018">(<a href="#ref-dresselAccuracyFairnessLimits2018" role="doc-biblioref">Dressel and Farid 2018</a>)</span>), few researchers in applied mental health research have made use of these tools to critically examine their own models <span class="citation" data-cites="timmonsCallActionAssessing2023">(<a href="#ref-timmonsCallActionAssessing2023" role="doc-biblioref">Timmons et al. 2023</a>)</span>. Thus, this study will also advocate for transparency in reporting fairness metrics alongside standard measures of model performance.</p>
