<meta name="citation_abstract" content="We developed a machine learning model that utilizes geolocation data to predict next-day lapse back to alcohol use. Context- and movement-based features were calculated as raw and change scores for feature engineering. Features were designed to represent clinically-meaningful lapse precursors. One hundred and forty six participants (50.7% male; mean age = 40.9; 87% White, 97.3% Non-Hispanic) in early recovery (1–8 weeks of abstinence) from alcohol use disorder provided continuous geolocation data for up to three months. Inner folds from grouped, nested cross-validation were used to select best models and evaluate the performance of the best performing model. The median area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was .71 across 300 validation sets. Three top performing features emerged: time spent at risky locations, time spent across various types of places, and time spent at locations where alcohol is available. Fairness analyses comparing auROCs across race/ethinicty, age, sex at birth, and income were used to identify the likelihood of differential performance of our model between subgroups within each class. All models exhibited differential performance across subgroups of race/ethnicity, sex at birth, age, and income, such that model performance was worse for non-white, female, and older participants, as well as those below the poverty line. This study represents foundational work carried out to explore predictive signal and important features for future integration into a continuous risk monitoring and support system designed to identify high lapse risk and relevant supports for individuals in recovery.

Traditional methods of capturing social, functional, and behavioral data are limited to the information that patients report back to their health care provider at selected points in time. As a result, these data are not accurate accounts of day-to-day functioning, as they are often influenced by biases in self-report. Mobile technology (mobile applications on smartphones, activity bracelets) has the potential to overcome such problems with traditional assessment and provide information about patient symptoms, behavior, and functioning in real time. Although the use of sensors and apps are widespread, several questions remain in the field regarding the reliability of off-the-shelf apps and sensors, use of these tools by consumers, and provider use of these data in clinical decision-making.;,citation_author=Patricia A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Using a mobile health application to reduce alcohol consumption: A mixed-methods evaluation of the drinkaware track &amp;amp;amp; calculate units application;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Smartphone applications (&amp;amp;quot;apps&amp;quot;) offer promise as tools to help people monitor and reduce their alcohol consumption. To date, few evaluations of alcohol reduction apps exist, with even fewer considering apps already available to the public. The aim of this study was to evaluate an existing publically available app, designed by Drinkaware, a UK-based alcohol awareness charity. METHODS: We adopted a mixed-methods design, analysing routinely collected app usage data to explore user characteristics and patterns of usage. Following this, in-depth interviews were conducted with a sub-sample of app users to examine perceptions of acceptability, usability and perceived effectiveness, as well as to provide recommendations on how to improve the app. RESULTS: One hundred nineteen thousand seven hundred thirteen people downloaded and entered data into the app over a 13-month period. High attrition was observed after 1 week. Users who engaged with the app tended to be &quot;high risk&quot; drinkers and to report being motivated &quot;to reduce drinking&quot; at the point of first download. In those who consistently engaged with the app over time, self-reported alcohol consumption levels reduced, with most change occurring in the first week of usage. Our qualitative findings indicate satisfaction with the usability of the app, but mixed feedback was given regarding individual features. Users expressed conflicting views concerning the type of feedback and notifications that the app currently provides. A common preference was expressed for more personalised content. CONCLUSIONS: The Drinkaware app is a useful tool to support behaviour change in individuals who are already motivated and committed to reducing their alcohol consumption. The Drinkaware app would benefit from greater personalisation and tailoring to promote longer term use. This evaluation provides insight into the usability and acceptability of various app features and contains a number of recommendations for improving user satisfaction and the potential effectiveness of apps designed to encourage reductions in alcohol consumption.;,citation_author=Sophie Attwood;,citation_author=Hannah Parke;,citation_author=John Larsen;,citation_author=Katie L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Relapse and Relapse Prevention;,citation_abstract=Abstract Most psychological disorders and problem behaviors are characterized by very high rates of postremittance relapse. Thus, advances in the long-term efficacy of psychological interventions require understanding the causes and processes of relapse, with the ultimate goal of developing strategies that reduce the probability of relapse. Existing psychological theory and interventions relevant to relapse and relapse prevention (RP) are reviewed, with a focus on addictive behaviors. The past two decades have produced increased attention toward the relapse problem and important advances in the conceptualization of relapse (i.e., as a process rather than a discrete event). Further progress will require the translation of basic theory into applied theory, the development of integrative theories of relapse, and the design and testing of theory-based, multimodal RP interventions.;,citation_author=Thomas H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cue dependency of nicotine self-administration and smoking;,citation_abstract=A paradox exists regarding the reinforcing properties of nicotine. The abuse liability associated with smoking equals or exceeds that of other addictive drugs, yet the euphoric, reinforcing and other psychological effects of nicotine, compared to these other drugs, are more subtle, are manifest under more restricted conditions, and do not readily predict the difficulty most smokers experience in achieving abstinence. One possible resolution to this apparent inconsistency is that environmental cues associated with drug delivery become conditioned reinforcers and take on powerful incentive properties that are critically important for sustaining smoking in humans and nicotine self-administration in animals. We tested this hypothesis by using a widely employed self-administration paradigm in which rats press a lever at high rates for 1 h/day to obtain intravenous infusions of nicotine that are paired with two types of visual stimuli: a chamber light that when turned on signals drug availability and a 1-s cue light that signals drug delivery. We show that these visual cues are at least as important as nicotine in sustaining a high rate of responding once self-administration has been established, in the degree to which withdrawing nicotine extinguishes the behavior, and in the reinstatement of lever pressing after extinction. Additional studies demonstrated that the importance of these cues was manifest under both fixed ratio and progressive ratio (PR) schedules of reinforcement. The possibility that nicotine-paired cues are as important as nicotine in smoking behavior should refocus our attention on the psychology and neurobiology of conditioned reinforcers in order to stimulate the development of more effective treatment programs for smoking cessation.;,citation_author=A.

Most existing systems require an interaction with the device, for example they may require the user to input his/her mood state at regular intervals. In this paper we seek to answer whether mobile phones can be used to unobtrusively monitor individuals affected by depressive mood disorders by analyzing only their mobility patterns from GPS traces. In order to get ground-truth measurements, we have developed a smartphone application that periodically collects the locations of the users and the answers to daily questionnaires that quantify their depressive mood. We demonstrate that there exists a significant correlation between mobility trace characteristics and the depressive moods. Finally, we present the design of models that are able to successfully predict changes in the depressive mood of individuals by analyzing their movements.;,citation_author=L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Realize, Analyze, Engage (RAE): A Digital Tool to Support Recovery from Substance Use Disorder;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Substance use disorders are a highly prevalent group of chronic diseases with devastating individual and public health consequences. Current treatment strategies suffer from high rates of relapse, or return to drug use, and novel solutions are desperately needed. Realize Analyze Engage (RAE) is a digital, mHealth intervention that focusses on real time, objective detection of high-risk events (stress and drug craving) to deploy just-in-time supportive interventions. The present study aims to (1) evaluate the accuracy and usability of the RAE system and (2) evaluate the impact of RAE on patient centered outcomes. METHODS: The first phase of the study will be an observational trial of N = 50 participants in outpatient treatment for SUD using the RAE system for 30 days. Accuracy of craving and stress detection algorithms will be evaluated, and usability of RAE will be explored via semi-structured interviews with participants and focus groups with SUD treatment clinicians. The second phase of the study will be a randomized controlled trial of RAE vs usual care to evaluate rates of return to use, retention in treatment, and quality of life. ANTICIPATED FINDINGS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS: The RAE platform is a potentially powerful tool to de-escalate stress and craving outside of the clinical milieu, and to connect with a support system needed most. RAE also aims to provide clinicians with actionable insight to understand patients’ level of risk, and contextual clues for their triggers in order to provide more personalized recovery support.;,citation_author=Stephanie Carreiro;,citation_author=Melissa Taylor;,citation_author=Sloke Shrestha;,citation_author=Megan Reinhardt;,citation_author=Nicole Gilbertson;,citation_author=Premananda Indic;,citation_publication_date=2021;,citation_cover_date=2021;,citation_year=2021;,citation_doi=10.20900/jpbs.20210002;,citation_issn=2398-385X;,citation_pmid=33748430;,citation_volume=6;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Psychiatry and Brain Science;">

This article introduces issues of discrimination to the data science community on its own terms. In it, we tour the familiar data mining process while providing a taxonomy of common practices that have the potential to produce unintended discrimination. We also survey how discrimination is commonly measured, and suggest how familiar development processes can be augmented to mitigate systems’ discriminatory potential.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Digital health tools for the passive monitoring of depression: A systematic review of methods;,citation_abstract=Abstract The use of digital tools to measure physiological and behavioural variables of potential relevance to mental health is a growing field sitting at the intersection between computer science, engineering, and clinical science. We summarised the literature on remote measuring technologies, mapping methodological challenges and threats to reproducibility, and identified leading digital signals for depression. Medical and computer science databases were searched between January 2007 and November 2019. Published studies linking depression and objective behavioural data obtained from smartphone and wearable device sensors in adults with unipolar depression and healthy subjects were included. A descriptive approach was taken to synthesise study methodologies. We included 51 studies and found threats to reproducibility and transparency arising from failure to provide comprehensive descriptions of recruitment strategies, sample information, feature construction and the determination and handling of missing data. The literature is characterised by small sample sizes, short follow-up duration and great variability in the quality of reporting, limiting the interpretability of pooled results. Bivariate analyses show consistency in statistically significant associations between depression and digital features from sleep, physical activity, location, and phone use data. Machine learning models found the predictive value of aggregated features. Given the pitfalls in the combined literature, these results should be taken purely as a starting point for hypothesis generation. Since this research is ultimately aimed at informing clinical practice, we recommend improvements in reporting standards including consideration of generalisability and reproducibility, such as wider diversity of samples, thorough reporting methodology and the reporting of potential bias in studies with numerous features.;,citation_author=Valeria De Angel;,citation_author=Serena Lewis;,citation_author=Katie White;,citation_author=Carolin Oetzmann;,citation_author=Daniel Leightley;,citation_author=Emanuela Oprea;,citation_author=Grace Lavelle;,citation_author=Faith Matcham;,citation_author=Alice Pace;,citation_author=David C.

Here, a predicted probability of, say, .7 should indicate that out of 100 cases with these environmental conditions, and hence the same predicted probability, the species should be present in 70 and absent in 30. Innovation A simple calibration plot shows that this is not necessarily the case, particularly not for overfitted models or algorithms that use non-likelihood target functions. As a consequence, “raw” predictions from such a model could easily be off by .2, are unsuitable for averaging across model types, and resulting maps hence be substantially distorted. The solution, a flexible calibration regression, is simple and can be applied whenever deviations are observed. Main conclusions “Raw”, uncalibrated probability predictions should be calibrated before interpreting or averaging them in a probabilistic way.;,citation_author=Carsten F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Identifying Behavioral Phenotypes of Loneliness and Social Isolation with Passive Sensing: Statistical Analysis, Data Mining and Machine Learning of Smartphone and Fitbit Data;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Feelings of loneliness are associated with poor physical and mental health. Detection of loneliness through passive sensing on personal devices can lead to the development of interventions aimed at decreasing rates of loneliness. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the potential of using passive sensing to infer levels of loneliness and to identify the corresponding behavioral patterns. METHODS: Data were collected from smartphones and Fitbits (Flex 2) of 160 college students over a semester. The participants completed the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) loneliness questionnaire at the beginning and end of the semester. For a classification purpose, the scores were categorized into high (questionnaire score$&amp;amp;amp;gt;$40) and low ($\leq$40) levels of loneliness. Daily features were extracted from both devices to capture activity and mobility, communication and phone usage, and sleep behaviors. The features were then averaged to generate semester-level features. We used 3 analytic methods: (1) statistical analysis to provide an overview of loneliness in college students, (2) data mining using the Apriori algorithm to extract behavior patterns associated with loneliness, and (3) machine learning classification to infer the level of loneliness and the change in levels of loneliness using an ensemble of gradient boosting and logistic regression algorithms with feature selection in a leave-one-student-out cross-validation manner. RESULTS: The average loneliness score from the presurveys and postsurveys was above 43 (presurvey SD 9.4 and postsurvey SD 10.4), and the majority of participants fell into the high loneliness category (scores above 40) with 63.8% (102/160) in the presurvey and 58.8% (94/160) in the postsurvey. Scores greater than 1 standard deviation above the mean were observed in 12.5% (20/160) of the participants in both pre- and postsurvey scores. The majority of scores, however, fell between 1 standard deviation below and above the mean (pre=66.9% [107/160] and post=73.1% [117/160]). Our machine learning pipeline achieved an accuracy of 80.2% in detecting the binary level of loneliness and an 88.4% accuracy in detecting change in the loneliness level. The mining of associations between classifier-selected behavioral features and loneliness indicated that compared with students with low loneliness, students with high levels of loneliness were spending less time outside of campus during evening hours on weekends and spending less time in places for social events in the evening on weekdays (support=17% and confidence=92%). The analysis also indicated that more activity and less sedentary behavior, especially in the evening, was associated with a decrease in levels of loneliness from the beginning of the semester to the end of it (support=31% and confidence=92%). CONCLUSIONS: Passive sensing has the potential for detecting loneliness in college students and identifying the associated behavioral patterns. These findings highlight intervention opportunities through mobile technology to reduce the impact of loneliness on individuals’ health and well-being.;,citation_author=Afsaneh Doryab;,citation_author=Daniella K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Real-time tracking of neighborhood surroundings and mood in urban drug misusers: Application of a new method to study behavior in its geographical context;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Maladaptive behaviors may be more fully understood and efficiently prevented by ambulatory tools that assess people’s ongoing experience in the context of their environment. METHODS: To demonstrate new field-deployable methods for assessing mood and behavior as a function of neighborhood surroundings (geographical momentary assessment; GMA), we collected time-stamped GPS data and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) ratings of mood, stress, and drug craving over 16 weeks at randomly prompted times during the waking hours of opioid-dependent polydrug users receiving methadone maintenance. Locations of EMA entries and participants’ travel tracks calculated for the 12 before each EMA entry were mapped. Associations between subjective ratings and objective environmental ratings were evaluated at the whole neighborhood and 12-h track levels. RESULTS: Participants (N=27) were compliant with GMA data collection; 3711 randomly prompted EMA entries were matched to specific locations. At the neighborhood level, physical disorder was negatively correlated with negative mood, stress, and heroin and cocaine craving (ps$&amp;amp;amp;lt;$.0001-.0335); drug activity was negatively correlated with stress, heroin and cocaine craving (ps .0009-.0134). Similar relationships were found for the environments around respondents’ tracks in the 12h preceding EMA entries. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the feasibility of GMA. The relationships between neighborhood characteristics and participants’ reports were counterintuitive and counter-hypothesized, and challenge some assumptions about how ostensibly stressful environments are associated with lived experience and how such environments ultimately impair health.

Objective smartphone data reflecting illness activity could facilitate early treatment and act as outcome in efficacy trials. A total of 29 patients with BD presenting with moderate to severe levels of depressive and manic symptoms used a smartphone-based self-monitoring system during 12 weeks. Objective smartphone data on behavioral activities were collected. Symptoms were clinically assessed every second week using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Young Mania Rating Scale. Objective smartphone data correlated with symptom severity. The more severe the depressive symptoms (1) the longer the smartphone’s screen was “on”/day, (2) more received incoming calls/day, (3) fewer outgoing calls/day were made, (4) less answered incoming calls/day, (5) the patients moved less between cell towers IDs/day. Conversely, the more severe the manic symptoms (1) more outgoing text messages/day sent, (2) the phone calls/day were longer, (3) the fewer number of characters in incoming text messages/day, (4) the lower duration of outgoing calls/day, (5) the patients moved more between cell towers IDs/day. Further, objective smartphone data were able to discriminate between affective states.

Smartphone-based geolocation sensors create opportunities for continuous monitoring and early intervention.We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Scopus by combining terms related to geolocation and smartphones with SMI concepts. Study selection and data extraction were done in duplicate.Eighteen publications describing 16 studies were included in our review. Eleven studies focused on bipolar disorder. Common geolocation-derived digital biomarkers were number of locations visited (n = 8), distance traveled (n = 8), time spent at prespecified locations (n = 7), and number of changes in GSM (Global System for Mobile communications) cell (n = 4). Twelve of 14 publications evaluating clinical aspects found an association between geolocation-derived digital biomarker and SMI concepts, especially mood. Geolocation-derived digital biomarkers were more strongly associated with SMI concepts than other information (eg, accelerometer data, smartphone activity, self-reported symptoms).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Tracking the When, Where, and With Whom of Alcohol Use: Integrating Ecological Momentary Assessment and Geospatial Data to Examine Risk for Alcohol-Related Problems;,citation_abstract=Prevention researchers have found that drinking in different contexts is related to different alcohol problems. Where and with whom people drink affects the types of alcohol-related problems they experience. Consequently, identifying those contexts that result in the greatest number of problems provides a novel opportunity to target new prevention efforts aimed at those contexts. However, identifying these contexts poses methodological challenges to prevention research. To overcome these challenges, researchers need tools that allow them to gather detailed information about when and where people choose to drink and how contextual factors influence drinking risks. New data collection and analysis techniques, such as activity-space analysis, which examines movement through different contexts, and ecological momentary assessment, which captures microlevel contextual changes as individuals move through their days, can advance the field of alcohol studies by providing detailed information on the use of drinking contexts, particularly when combined. Data acquired through these methods allow researchers to better identify those con-texts where and conditions under which drinking and problems related to drinking occur. Use of these methods will allow prevention practitioners to target prevention efforts to those contexts that place most drinkers at risk and tailor prevention efforts to each context for specific outcomes.;,citation_author=Bridget Freisthler;,citation_author=Sharon Lipperman-Kreda;,citation_author=Melina Bersamin;,citation_author=Paul J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Structural racism in precision medicine: Leaving no one behind;,citation_abstract=Abstract Background Precision medicine (PM) is an emerging approach to individualized care. It aims to help physicians better comprehend and predict the needs of their patients while effectively adopting in a timely manner the most suitable treatment by promoting the sharing of health data and the implementation of learning healthcare systems. Alongside its promises, PM also entails the risk of exacerbating healthcare inequalities, in particular between ethnoracial groups. One often-neglected underlying reason why this might happen is the impact of structural racism on PM initiatives. Raising awareness as to how structural racism can influence PM initiatives is paramount to avoid that PM ends up reproducing the pre-existing health inequalities between different ethnoracial groups and contributing to the loss of trust in healthcare by minority groups. Main body We analyse three nodes of a process flow where structural racism can affect PM’s implementation. These are: (i) the collection of biased health data during the initial encounter of minority groups with the healthcare system and researchers, (ii) the integration of biased health data for minority groups in PM initiatives and (iii) the influence of structural racism on the deliverables of PM initiatives for minority groups. We underscore that underappreciation of structural racism by stakeholders involved in the PM ecosystem can be at odds with the ambition of ensuring social and racial justice. Potential specific actions related to the analysed nodes are then formulated to help ensure that PM truly adheres to the goal of leaving no one behind , as endorsed by member states of the United Nations for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Conclusion Structural racism has been entrenched in our societies for centuries and it would be naïve to believe that its impacts will not spill over in the era of PM. PM initiatives need to pay special attention to the discriminatory and harmful impacts that structural racism could have on minority groups involved in their respective projects. It is only by acknowledging and discussing the existence of implicit racial biases&nbsp;and trust issues in healthcare and research domains that proper interventions to remedy them can be implemented.;,citation_author=Lester Darryl Geneviève;,citation_author=Andrea Martani;,citation_author=David Shaw;,citation_author=Bernice Simone Elger;,citation_author=Tenzin Wangmo;,citation_publication_date=2020-12;,citation_cover_date=2020-12;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1186/s12910-020-0457-8;,citation_issn=1472-6939;,citation_volume=21;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=BMC Medical Ethics;">

We sought to quantify gender differences in alcohol services utilization, overall and by type, using national longitudinal data and to explore potential gender differences in perceived need for help and reasons for not seeking help. Methods We analyzed data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions from White, African American, and Hispanic adults ( n &nbsp;=&nbsp;2,592) who met DSM-IV criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence at Wave 1 (2000 to 2001). We tested gender differences in Wave 2 (2004 to 2005) services utilization, perceived need for help, and treatment barriers using Rao-Scott chi-square tests and assessed predictors of outcomes in multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for problem severity, co-occurring disorders, and demographics. Results Women had much lower odds than men of utilizing any alcohol service (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.53; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.33, 0.86), specialty services (aOR 0.41; 95% CI 0.19, 0.87), and 12-step groups (aOR 0.39; 95% CI 0.21, 0.71). Perceived need for help among those who had not used any services was very low (5%), with no gender difference. Further, men and women reported equivalent numbers of treatment barriers and the same rank order for the most frequently endorsed barriers. However, women were twice as likely as men to think a problem would get better by itself—the most frequent reason for not seeking help (47% vs. 24%, p &nbsp;$&amp;amp;amp;lt;~$0.001), and men were more likely than women to report unsuccessful past help-seeking and not thinking anyone could help (19% vs. 3%, p &nbsp;$&amp;lt;~$0.001 and 17% vs. 5%, p &nbsp;=&nbsp;0.001, respectively).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Comparison of a smartphone app for alcohol use disorders with an Internet-based intervention plus bibliotherapy: A pilot study;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE: To date, no research has evaluated the efficacy of a stand-alone, smartphone-based intervention for individuals with an alcohol use disorder. The current pilot study evaluated the short-term outcomes of a smartphone-based intervention for alcohol use disorders compared with an Internet-based brief motivational intervention plus bibliotherapy. METHOD: Adults (18 to 45 years old) with an alcohol use disorder received either the Location-Based Monitoring and Intervention for Alcohol Use Disorders (LBMI-A; n = 28), a smartphone-based intervention, or the online Drinker’s Check-up plus bibliotherapy (DCU + bib; n = 26). These groups were compared using the Timeline Followback interview for percent days abstinent (PDA), percent heavy drinking days (PHDD), and drinks per week (DPW) from baseline to 6 weeks after the introduction of the interventions. RESULTS: Multilevel models revealed that the LBMI-A resulted in a significant increase in PDA over the course of the study, whereas the DCU + bib did not. Effect sizes for change from baseline for PDA suggest that the DCU + bib resulted in moderate a decrease, whereas the LBMI-A resulted in a large increase in PDA. Both interventions resulted in significant decreases in PHDD and DPW. The LBMI-A produced larger reductions in the first 3 to 4 weeks after the intervention was introduced than the DCU + bib. On weeks with greater LBMI-A usage, participants reported less DPW and PHDD. CONCLUSIONS: Both interventions resulted in significant decreases in alcohol use over the 6-week trial, which is promising for stand-alone technology-based intervention systems aimed at individuals with an alcohol use disorder.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Escaping the Impossibility of Fairness: From Formal to Substantive Algorithmic Fairness;,citation_abstract=Efforts to promote equitable public policy with algorithms appear to be fundamentally constrained by the “impossibility of fairness” (an incompatibility between mathematical definitions of fairness). This technical limitation raises a central question about algorithmic fairness: How can computer scientists and policymakers support equitable policy reforms with algorithms? In this article, I argue that promoting justice with algorithms requires reforming the methodology of algorithmic fairness. First, I diagnose the problems of the current methodology for algorithmic fairness, which I call “formal algorithmic fairness.” Because formal algorithmic fairness restricts analysis to isolated decision-making procedures, it&nbsp;leads to the impossibility of fairness and to models that exacerbate oppression despite appearing “fair.” Second, I draw on theories of substantive equality from law and philosophy to propose an alternative methodology, which I call “substantive algorithmic fairness.” Because substantive algorithmic fairness takes a more expansive scope of analysis, it enables an escape from the impossibility of fairness and provides a rigorous guide for alleviating injustice with algorithms. In sum, substantive algorithmic fairness presents a new direction for algorithmic fairness: away from formal mathematical models of “fair” decision-making and toward substantive evaluations of whether and&nbsp;how algorithms can promote justice&nbsp;in practice.;,citation_author=Ben Green;,citation_publication_date=2022-10;,citation_cover_date=2022-10;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1007/s13347-022-00584-6;,citation_issn=2210-5441;,citation_volume=35;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Philosophy &amp;amp;amp; Technology;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Beyond Distributive Fairness in Algorithmic Decision Making: Feature Selection for Procedurally Fair Learning;,citation_abstract=With widespread use of machine learning methods in numerous domains involving humans, several studies have raised questions about the potential for unfairness towards certain individuals or groups. A number of recent works have proposed methods to measure and eliminate unfairness from machine learning models. However, most of this work has focused on only one dimension of fair decision making: distributive fairness, i.e., the fairness of the decision outcomes. In this work, we leverage the rich literature on organizational justice and focus on another dimension of fair decision making: procedural fairness, i.e., the fairness of the decision making process. We propose measures for procedural fairness that consider the input features used in the decision process, and evaluate the moral judgments of humans regarding the use of these features. We operationalize these measures on two real world datasets using human surveys on the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) platform, demonstrating that our measures capture important properties of procedurally fair decision making.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=What does ’access to health care’ mean?;,citation_abstract=Facilitating access is concerned with helping people to command appropriate health care resources in order to preserve or improve their health. Access is a complex concept and at least four aspects require evaluation. If services are available and there is an adequate supply of services, then the opportunity to obtain health care exists, and a population may ’have access’ to services. The extent to which a population ’gains access’ also depends on financial, organisational and social or cultural barriers that limit the utilisation of services. Thus access measured in terms of utilisation is dependent on the affordability, physical accessibility and acceptability of services and not merely adequacy of supply. Services available must be relevant and effective if the population is to ’gain access to satisfactory health outcomes’. The availability of services, and barriers to access, have to be considered in the context of the differing perspectives, health needs and material and cultural settings of diverse groups in society. Equity of access may be measured in terms of the availability, utilisation or outcomes of services.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Psychiatric Comorbidity as a Function of Severity: DSM-5 Alcohol Use Disorder and HiTOP Classification of Mental Disorders;,citation_abstract=Background Understanding the comorbidity of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and other psychiatric diagnoses has been a long-standing interest of researchers and mental health professionals. Comorbidity is often examined via the diagnostic co-occurrence of discrete, categorical diagnoses, which is incongruent with increasingly supported dimensional approaches of psychiatric classification and diagnosis, and for AUD more specifically. The present study examined associations between DSM-5 AUD and psychiatric symptoms of other DSM-IV and DSM-5 disorders categorically, and dimensionally organized according to the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) spectra (e.g., Internalizing, Disinhibited Externalizing). Methods The comorbidity of AUD with other psychological disorders was examined in 2 independent nationally representative samples of past-year drinkers via an initial examination in the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) Wave 2 and replicated in NESARC-III. Results Analyses focusing on psychopathology symptom counts organized by spectra demonstrated that greater AUD severity was associated with a higher number of symptoms across HiTOP spectra. Traditional categorical analyses also demonstrated increasing prevalence as a monotonic function of DSM-5 AUD severity gradients. Conclusions This study indicates that AUD and other psychiatric disorder comorbidity implies increased presence of multiple forms of psychopathology with a corresponding increased number of symptoms across hierarchical spectra. Greater AUD severity increases the likelihood of other psychopathology and, when present, “more severe” presentations. That is, on average, a given disorder (e.g., depression) is more severe when copresenting with an AUD, and increases in severity along with the AUD.;,citation_author=Ashley C.

While circadian rhythms dictate the timing of daily recurring activities such as sleep, activity, and meals, conversely, these activities represent time cues, so called $<$italic$>$Zeitgebers$<$/italic$>$, that the circadian system uses to synchronize with the environment. Here we present a study protocol for our newly developed therapy approach for AUD patients, in which we take advantage of this mutual influence and stabilize and strengthen their circadian system by creating strict daily schedules for daily $<$italic$>$Zeitgeber$<$/italic$>$ activities. Since every person has a circadian system with its own characteristics and is subject to social obligations, the daily plans are personalized for each test person. Our hypothesis is that a regular exposure to $<$italic$>$Zeitgebers$<$/italic$>$ stabilizes behavioral and physiological circadian rhythms and thereby reduces the risk of alcohol relapses and depressive symptoms and facilitates physical recovery in AUD patients during the 1st weeks of their addiction therapy.$<$/p$><$p$><$bold$>$Methods/design:$<$/bold$>$ The study is a 6-weeks single site trial with a controlled, randomized, single-blinded, parallel-group design including patients with a diagnosis of AUD.

Questionnaires and physiological assessments of both groups are conducted before and immediately after the intervention or control treatment.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Differential Fairness: An Intersectional Framework for Fair AI;,citation_abstract=We propose definitions of fairness in machine learning and artificial intelligence systems that are informed by the framework of intersectionality, a critical lens from the legal, social science, and humanities literature which analyzes how interlocking systems of power and oppression affect individuals along overlapping dimensions including gender, race, sexual orientation, class, and disability. We show that our criteria behave sensibly for any subset of the set of protected attributes, and we prove economic, privacy, and generalization guarantees. Our theoretical results show that our criteria meaningfully operationalize AI fairness in terms of real-world harms, making the measurements interpretable in a manner analogous to differential privacy. We provide a simple learning algorithm using deterministic gradient methods, which respects our intersectional fairness criteria. The measurement of fairness becomes statistically challenging in the minibatch setting due to data sparsity, which increases rapidly in the number of protected attributes and in the values per protected attribute. To address this, we further develop a practical learning algorithm using stochastic gradient methods which incorporates stochastic estimation of the intersectional fairness criteria on minibatches to scale up to big data. Case studies on census data, the COMPAS criminal recidivism dataset, the HHP hospitalization data, and a loan application dataset from HMDA demonstrate the utility of our methods.;,citation_author=Rashidul Islam;,citation_author=Kamrun Naher Keya;,citation_author=Shimei Pan;,citation_author=Anand D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Potent Effect of Environmental Context on Relapse to Alcohol-Seeking After Extinction;,citation_abstract=Environments in which the pharmacological effects of alcohol have been experienced become potent triggers for relapse in abstinent humans. Animal models developed to study the effect of environmental contexts on relapse to alcohol-seeking behavior demonstrate that alcohol-seeking is renewed by exposure to an alcohol-associated context, following the extinction of alcohol-seeking in a different context. Hence, contexts in which alcohol conditioning and extinction learning occur can be critical determinants for whether or not alcohol-seeking behavior is observed. This review summarizes preclinical research to date examining the role of alcohol contexts on the reinstatement of extinguished responding for alcohol. Behavioral studies have elucidated factors that are important for eliciting context-dependent relapse, and have uncovered novel interactions between alcohol-seeking driven by discrete alcohol cues in different contexts. Neuropharmacological studies provide substantial evidence for a role of dopaminergic systems in context-dependent reinstatement, and growing support for opioidergic mechanisms as well. Several key limbic brain regions have been identified in the modulation of alcohol-seeking by context, supporting a proposed neural circuit that includes the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, basolateral amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, and the paraventricular thalamus.;,citation_author=Patricia H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Balancing Fairness: Unveiling the Potential of SMOTE-Driven Oversampling in AI Model Enhancement;,citation_abstract=In the contemporary landscape of decision support systems, machine learning (ML) algorithms assume a pivotal role in diverse domains, including job screening and loan approvals. Despite their extensive utilization, a persistent challenge arises in the form of biased outcomes, notably influenced by sensitive attributes such as gender and ethnicity. While current research heavily leans on these attributes for fairness, the scarcity of data due to privacy and legal constraints poses a substantial hurdle. Furthermore, imbalances in real-world datasets necessitate the use of class balancing techniques, but conflicting findings on their impact on bias mitigation and overall model performance complicate the pursuit of fairness. This paper conducts a comprehensive investigation, addressing the unique challenge of constructing fair models without explicit reliance on sensitive attributes. It specifically examines the effectiveness of Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE)-driven oversampling methods. The study’s findings reveal a significant enhancement in classification performance through SMOTE-driven techniques. These insights advocate for the thoughtful integration of SMOTE-driven oversampling techniques to achieve a balance between model fairness and accuracy.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Considering Drug-Associated Contexts in Substance Use Disorders and Treatment Development;,citation_abstract=Environmental contexts that are reliably associated with the use of pharmacologically active substances are hypothesized to contribute to substance use disorders. In this review, we provide an updated summary of parallel preclinical and human studies that support this hypothesis. Research conducted in rats shows that environmental contexts that are reliably paired with drug use can renew extinguished drug-seeking behavior and amplify responding elicited by discrete, drug-predictive cues. Akin to drug-associated contexts, interoceptive drug stimuli produced by the psychopharmacological effects of drugs can also influence learning and memory processes that play a role in substance use disorders. Findings from human laboratory studies show that drug-associated contexts, including social stimuli, can have profound effects on cue reactivity, drug use, and drug-related cognitive expectancies. This translationally relevant research supports the idea that treatments for substance use disorders could be improved by considering drug-associated contexts as a factor in treatment interventions. We conclude this review with ideas for how to integrate drug-associated contexts into treatment-oriented research based on 4 approaches: pharmacology, brain stimulation, mindfulness-based relapse prevention, and cognitive behavioral group therapy.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mitigating Subgroup Unfairness in Machine Learning Classifiers: A Data-Driven Approach;,citation_abstract=Fairness in machine learning, particularly in classifiers, is receiving increasing attention. However, most studies on this topic focus on fairness metrics for a limited number of predefined groups and do not address fairness across intersectional subgroups. In this paper, we investigate ways to improve subgroup fairness where subgroups are defined by the intersection of protected attributes. Specifically, our paper reveals the correlation between the representation bias of training data and model fairness. We demonstrate that biased sample collection due to historical biases and a lack of control over data collection can lead to unfairness in learned models. We introduce the concept of an “Implicit Biased Set (IBS)”, which refers to regions in the intersectional attribute space where positive and negative examples are not proportionately represented. For example, if our training data set has a disproportionate representation of black male recidivists, then criminal risk assessment tools are more likely to discriminate against black males, even if they are innocent. We propose an efficient pre-processing approach that initially identifies IBS and then employs techniques to remedy the data collection within IBS. Our evaluation shows that our method effectively mitigates various subgroup biases regardless of the downstream machine learning models used.;,citation_author=Yin Lin;,citation_author=Samika Gupta;,citation_author=H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A unified approach to interpreting model predictions;,citation_abstract=Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction’s accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Treating alcoholism as a chronic disease: Approaches to long-term continuing care;,citation_abstract=For many patients, alcohol and other drug (AOD) use disorders are chronic, recurring conditions involving multiple cycles of treatment, abstinence, and relapse. To disrupt this cycle, treatment can include continuing care to reduce the risk of relapse. The most commonly used treatment approach is initial intensive inpatient or outpatient care based on 12-step principles, followed by continuing care involving self-help groups, 12-step group counseling, or individual therapy. Although these programs can be effective, many patients drop out of initial treatment or do not complete continuing care. Thus, researchers and clinicians have begun to develop alternative approaches to enhance treatment retention in both initial and continuing care. One focus of these efforts has been the design of extended treatment models. These approaches increasingly blur the distinction between initial and continuing care and aim to prolong treatment participation by providing a continuum of care. Other researchers have focused on developing alternative treatment strategies (e.g., telephone-based interventions) that go beyond traditional settings and adaptive treatment algorithms that may improve outcomes for clients who do not respond well to traditional approaches.;,citation_author=James R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Designing Effective Movement Digital Biomarkers for Unobtrusive Emotional State Mobile Monitoring;,citation_abstract=Mobile sensing technologies and machine learning techniques have been successfully exploited to build effective systems for mental health monitoring and intervention. Various approaches have recently been proposed to effectively exploit contextual information such as mobility, communication and mobile usage patterns for quantifying users’ emotional states and wellbeing. In particular, it has been shown that location information collected by means of smartphones can be successfully used to monitor and predict depression levels, as measured by means of standard scores such as PHQ-8. In this paper, we investigate the design of novel digital biomarkers based on the fine-grained characterization of the mobility patterns of a user, also considering the temporal dimension of their movements (e.g., sequence of places visited by them). We show that the proposed biomarkers have a statistically significant association with emotional states. We also demonstrate that emotional states have a stronger relationship with mobility patterns of weekdays compared to all days of a week. Finally, we discuss the challenges in using these biomarkers in the implementation of &amp;amp;amp;quot;emotion-aware&amp;quot; systems for digital health.;,citation_author=Abhinav Mehrotra;,citation_author=Mirco Musolesi;,citation_publication_date=2017-06;,citation_cover_date=2017-06;,citation_year=2017;,citation_doi=10.1145/3089341.3089342;,citation_isbn=978-1-4503-4963-5;,citation_conference_title=Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Digital Biomarkers;,citation_conference=Association for Computing Machinery;,citation_series_title=DigitalBiomarkers ’17;">

A major factor that obstructs the attainment of abstinence is the persistence of maladaptive drug-associated memories, which can maintain drug-seeking and taking behaviour and promote unconscious relapse of these habits. Thus, addiction can be conceptualised as a disorder of aberrant learning of the formation of strong instrumental memories linking actions to drug-seeking and taking outcomes that ultimately are expressed as persistent stimulus-response habits; of previously neutral environmental stimuli that become associated with drug highs (and/or withdrawal states) through pavlovian conditioning, and of the subsequent interactions between pavlovian and instrumental memories to influence relapse behaviour. Understanding the psychological, neurobiological and molecular basis of these drug memories may produce new methods of pro-abstinence, anti-relapse treatments for addiction.;,citation_author=Amy L.

DESIGN AND MEASURES: A sample of individuals (n = 461) who initiated help-seeking was surveyed at baseline and 1 year, 3 years, 8 years and 16 years later. Participants provided information on their life history of drinking, alcohol-related functioning and life context and coping. FINDINGS: Compared to individuals who obtained help, those who did not were less likely to achieve 3-year remission and subsequently were more likely to relapse. Less alcohol consumption and fewer drinking problems, more self-efficacy and less reliance on avoidance coping at baseline predicted 3-year remission; this was especially true of individuals who remitted without help. Among individuals who were remitted at 3 years, those who consumed more alcohol but were less likely to see their drinking as a significant problem, had less self-efficacy, and relied more on avoidance coping, were more likely to relapse by 16 years. These findings held for individuals who initially obtained help and for those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: Natural remission may be followed by a high likelihood of relapse; thus, preventive interventions may be indicated to forestall future alcohol problems among individuals who cut down temporarily on drinking on their own.;,citation_author=Rudolf H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Depression predictions from GPS-based mobility do not generalize well to large demographically heterogeneous samples;,citation_abstract=Depression is one of the most common mental health issues in the United States, affecting the lives of millions of people suffering from it as well as those close to them. Recent advances in research on mobile sensing technologies and machine learning have suggested that a person’s depression can be passively measured by observing patterns in people’s mobility behaviors. However, the majority of work in this area has relied on highly homogeneous samples, most frequently college students. In this study, we analyse over 57 million GPS data points to show that the same procedure that leads to high prediction accuracy in a homogeneous student sample (N = 57; AUC = 0.82), leads to accuracies only slightly higher than chance in a U.S.-wide sample that is heterogeneous in its socio-demographic composition as well as mobility patterns (N = 5,262; AUC = 0.57). This pattern holds across three different modelling approaches which consider both linear and non-linear relationships. Further analyses suggest that the prediction accuracy is low across different socio-demographic groups, and that training the models on more homogeneous subsamples does not substantially improve prediction accuracy.

Such mobility behaviours likely influence and are influenced by people’s subjective well–being. However, past research examining the links between mobility behaviours and well–being has been inconclusive. Here, we provide a comprehensive investigation of these relationships by examining individual differences in two types of mobility behaviours (movement patterns and places visited) and their relationship to six indicators of subjective well–being (depression, loneliness, anxiety, stress, affect, and energy) at two different temporal levels of analysis (two–week tendencies and daily level). Using data from a large smartphone–based longitudinal study (N = 1765), we show that (i) movement patterns assessed via GPS data (distance travelled, entropy, and irregularity) and (ii) places visited assessed via experience sampling reports (home, work, and social places) are associated with subjective well–being at the between and within person levels. Our findings suggest that distance travelled is related to anxiety, affect, and stress, irregularity is related to depression and loneliness, and spending time in social places is negatively associated with loneliness.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Predicting Depression in Adolescents Using Mobile and Wearable Sensors: Multimodal Machine Learning–Based Exploratory Study;,citation_abstract=Background Depression levels in adolescents have trended upward over the past several years. According to a 2020 survey by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 4.1 million US adolescents have experienced at least one major depressive episode. This number constitutes approximately 16% of adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. However, only 32.3% of adolescents received some form of specialized or nonspecialized treatment. Identifying worsening symptoms earlier using mobile and wearable sensors may lead to earlier intervention. Most studies on predicting depression using sensor-based data are geared toward the adult population. Very few studies look into predicting depression in adolescents. Objective The aim of our work was to study passively sensed data from adolescents with depression and investigate the predictive capabilities of 2 machine learning approaches to predict depression scores and change in depression levels in adolescents. This work also provided an in-depth analysis of sensor features that serve as key indicators of change in depressive symptoms and the effect of variation of data samples on model accuracy levels. Methods This study included 55 adolescents with symptoms of depression aged 12 to 17 years. Each participant was passively monitored through smartphone sensors and Fitbit wearable devices for 24 weeks. Passive sensors collected call, conversation, location, and heart rate information daily. Following data preprocessing, 67% (37/55) of the participants in the aggregated data set were analyzed. Weekly Patient Health Questionnaire-9 surveys answered by participants served as the ground truth. We applied regression-based approaches to predict the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 depression score and change in depression severity. These approaches were consolidated using universal and personalized modeling strategies. The universal strategies consisted of Leave One Participant Out and Leave Week X Out. The personalized strategy models were based on Accumulated Weeks and Leave One Week One User Instance Out. Linear and nonlinear machine learning algorithms were trained to model the data. Results We observed that personalized approaches performed better on adolescent depression prediction compared with universal approaches. The best models were able to predict depression score and weekly change in depression level with root mean squared errors of 2.83 and 3.21, respectively, following the Accumulated Weeks personalized modeling strategy. Our feature importance investigation showed that the contribution of screen-, call-, and location-based features influenced optimal models and were predictive of adolescent depression. Conclusions This study provides insight into the feasibility of using passively sensed data for predicting adolescent depression. We demonstrated prediction capabilities in terms of depression score and change in depression level. The prediction results revealed that personalized models performed better on adolescents than universal approaches. Feature importance provided a better understanding of depression and sensor data.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Context-Sensing Mobile Phone App (Q Sense) for Smoking Cessation: A Mixed-Methods Study;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: A major cause of lapse and relapse to smoking during a quit attempt is craving triggered by cues from a smoker’s immediate environment. To help smokers address these cue-induced cravings when attempting to quit, we have developed a context-aware smoking cessation app, Q Sense, which uses a smoking episode-reporting system combined with location sensing and geofencing to tailor support content and trigger support delivery in real time. OBJECTIVE: We sought to (1) assess smokers’ compliance with reporting their smoking in real time and identify reasons for noncompliance, (2) assess the app’s accuracy in identifying user-specific high-risk locations for smoking, (3) explore the feasibility and user perspective of geofence-triggered support, and (4) identify any technological issues or privacy concerns. METHODS: An explanatory sequential mixed-methods design was used, where data collected by the app informed semistructured interviews. Participants were smokers who owned an Android mobile phone and were willing to set a quit date within one month (N=15). App data included smoking reports with context information and geolocation, end-of-day (EoD) surveys of smoking beliefs and behavior, support message ratings, and app interaction data. Interviews were undertaken and analyzed thematically (N=13). Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed separately and findings presented sequentially. RESULTS: Out of 15 participants, 3 (20%) discontinued use of the app prematurely. Pre-quit date, the mean number of smoking reports received was 37.8 (SD 21.2) per participant, or 2.0 (SD 2.2) per day per participant. EoD surveys indicated that participants underreported smoking on at least 56.2% of days. Geolocation was collected in 97.0% of smoking reports with a mean accuracy of 31.6 (SD 16.8) meters. A total of 5 out of 9 (56%) eligible participants received geofence-triggered support. Interaction data indicated that 50.0% (137/274) of geofence-triggered message notifications were tapped within 30 minutes of being generated, resulting in delivery of a support message, and 78.2% (158/202) of delivered messages were rated by participants. Qualitative findings identified multiple reasons for noncompliance in reporting smoking, most notably due to environmental constraints and forgetting. Participants verified the app’s identification of their smoking locations, were largely positive about the value of geofence-triggered support, and had no privacy concerns about the data collected by the app. CONCLUSIONS: User-initiated self-report is feasible for training a cessation app about an individual’s smoking behavior, although underreporting is likely. Geofencing was a reliable and accurate method of identifying smoking locations, and geofence-triggered support was regarded positively by participants.;,citation_author=Felix Naughton;,citation_author=Sarah Hopewell;,citation_author=Neal Lathia;,citation_author=Rik Schalbroeck;,citation_author=Chloë Brown;,citation_author=Cecilia Mascolo;,citation_author=Andy McEwen;,citation_author=Stephen Sutton;,citation_publication_date=2016-09;,citation_cover_date=2016-09;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.2196/mhealth.5787;,citation_issn=2291-5222;,citation_pmid=27637405;,citation_volume=4;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=JMIR mHealth and uHealth;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mood ratings and digital biomarkers from smartphone and wearable data differentiates and predicts depression status: A longitudinal data analysis;,citation_abstract=Depression is a prevalent mental disorder. Current clinical and self-reported assessment methods of depression are laborious and incur recall bias. Their sporadic nature often misses severity fluctuations. Previous research highlights the potential of in-situ quantification of human behaviour using mobile sensors to augment traditional methods of depression management. In this paper, we study whether self-reported mood scores and passive smartphone and wearable sensor data could be used to classify people as depressed or non-depressed. In a longitudinal study, our participants provided daily mood (valence and arousal) scores and collected data using their smartphones and Oura Rings. We computed daily aggregations of mood, sleep, physical activity, phone usage, and GPS mobility from raw data to study the differences between the depressed and non-depressed groups and created population-level Machine Learning classification models of depression. We found statistically significant differences in GPS mobility, phone usage, sleep, physical activity and mood between depressed and non-depressed groups. An XGBoost model with daily aggregations of mood and sensor data as predictors classified participants with an accuracy of 81.43% and an Area Under the Curve of 82.31%. A Support Vector Machine using only sensor-based predictors had an accuracy of 77.06% and an Area Under the Curve of 74.25%.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Detecting Bipolar Depression From Geographic Location Data;,citation_abstract=Objective: This paper aims to identify periods of depression using geolocation movements recorded from mobile phones in a prospective community study of individuals with bipolar disorder (BD). Methods: Anonymized geographic location recordings from 22 BD participants and 14 healthy controls (HC) were collected over 3 months. Participants reported their depressive symptomatology using a weekly questionnaire (QIDS-SR16). Recorded location data were preprocessed by detecting and removing imprecise data points and features were extracted to assess the level and regularity of geographic movements of the participant. A subset of features were selected using a wrapper feature selection method and presented to 1) a linear regression model and a quadratic generalized linear model with a logistic link function for questionnaire score estimation; and 2) a quadratic discriminant analysis classifier for depression detection in BD participants based on their questionnaire responses. Results: HC participants did not report depressive symptoms and their features showed similar distributions to nondepressed BD participants. Questionnaire score estimation using geolocation-derived features from BD participants demonstrated an optimal mean absolute error rate of 3.73, while depression detection demonstrated an optimal (median  IQR) F1 score of 0.857  0.022 using five features (classification accuracy: 0.849  0.016; sensitivity: 0.839  0.014; specificity: 0.872  0.047). Conclusion: These results demonstrate a strong link between geographic movements and depression in bipolar disorder. Significance: To our knowledge, this is the first community study of passively recorded objective markers of depression in bipolar disorder of this scale.

This study moves this discussion to a new domain: phone-based mental health assessment algorithms. It is important to ensure that such algorithms do not contribute to gender disparities through biased predictions across gender groups. Objective This research aimed to analyze the susceptibility of multiple commonly used machine learning approaches for gender bias in mobile mental health assessment and explore the use of an algorithmic disparate impact remover (DIR) approach to reduce bias levels while maintaining high accuracy. Methods First, we performed preprocessing and model training using the data set (N=55) obtained from a previous study. Accuracy levels and differences in accuracy across genders were computed using 5 different machine learning models. We selected the random forest model, which yielded the highest accuracy, for a more detailed audit and computed multiple metrics that are commonly used for fairness in the machine learning literature. Finally, we applied the DIR approach to reduce bias in the mental health assessment algorithm. Results The highest observed accuracy for the mental health assessment was 78.57%. Although this accuracy level raises optimism, the audit based on gender revealed that the performance of the algorithm was statistically significantly different between the male and female groups (eg, difference in accuracy across genders was 15.85%; P$&amp;amp;amp;lt;$.001). Similar trends were obtained for other fairness metrics. This disparity in performance was found to reduce significantly after the application of the DIR approach by adapting the data used for modeling (eg, the difference in accuracy across genders was 1.66%, and the reduction is statistically significant with P$&amp;lt;$.001). Conclusions This study grounds the need for algorithmic auditing in phone-based mental health assessment algorithms and the use of gender as a protected attribute to study fairness in such settings. Such audits and remedial steps are the building blocks for the widespread adoption of fair and accurate mental health assessment algorithms in the future.;,citation_author=Jinkyung Park;,citation_author=Ramanathan Arunachalam;,citation_author=Vincent Silenzio;,citation_author=Vivek K Singh;,citation_publication_date=2022-06;,citation_cover_date=2022-06;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.2196/34366;,citation_issn=2561-326X;,citation_volume=6;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=JMIR Formative Research;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Defining equity in health;,citation_abstract=Study objective: To propose a definition of health equity to guide operationalisation and measurement, and to discuss the practical importance of clarity in defining this concept. Design: Conceptual discussion. Setting, Patients/Participants, and Main results: not applicable. Conclusions: For the purposes of measurement and operationalisation, equity in health is the absence of systematic disparities in health (or in the major social determinants of health) between groups with different levels of underlying social advantage/disadvantage—that is, wealth, power, or prestige. Inequities in health systematically put groups of people who are already socially disadvantaged (for example, by virtue of being poor, female, and/or members of a disenfranchised racial, ethnic, or religious group) at further disadvantage with respect to their health; health is essential to wellbeing and to overcoming other effects of social disadvantage. Equity is an ethical principle; it also is consonant with and closely related to human rights principles. The proposed definition of equity supports operationalisation of the right to the highest attainable standard of health as indicated by the health status of the most socially advantaged group. Assessing health equity requires comparing health and its social determinants between more and less advantaged social groups. These comparisons are essential to assess whether national and international policies are leading toward or away from greater social justice in health.;,citation_author=P Braveman;,citation_author=S Gruskin;,citation_publication_date=2003-04;,citation_cover_date=2003-04;,citation_year=2003;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1136/jech.57.4.254;,citation_volume=57;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Ensuring Fairness in Machine Learning to Advance Health Equity;,citation_abstract=Machine learning is used increasingly in clinical care to improve diagnosis, treatment selection, and health system efficiency. Because machine-learning models learn from historically collected data, populations that have experienced human and structural biases in the past-called protected groups-are vulnerable to harm by incorrect predictions or withholding of resources. This article describes how model design, biases in data, and the interactions of model predictions with clinicians and patients may exacerbate health care disparities. Rather than simply guarding against these harms passively, machine-learning systems should be used proactively to advance health equity. For that goal to be achieved, principles of distributive justice must be incorporated into model design, deployment, and evaluation. The article describes several technical implementations of distributive justice-specifically those that ensure equality in patient outcomes, performance, and resource allocation-and guides clinicians as to when they should prioritize each principle. Machine learning is providing increasingly sophisticated decision support and population-level monitoring, and it should encode principles of justice to ensure that models benefit all patients.;,citation_author=Alvin Rajkomar;,citation_author=Michaela Hardt;,citation_author=Michael D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Geolocation as a Digital Phenotyping Measure of Negative Symptoms and Functional Outcome;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE: Negative symptoms and functional outcome have traditionally been assessed using clinical rating scales, which rely on retrospective self-reports and have several inherent limitations that impact validity. These issues may be addressed with more objective digital phenotyping measures. In the current study, we evaluated the psychometric properties of a novel &amp;amp;amp;quot;passive&amp;quot; digital phenotyping method: geolocation. METHOD: Participants included outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (SZ: n = 44), outpatients with bipolar disorder (BD: n =19), and demographically matched healthy controls (CN: n = 42) who completed 6 days of &quot;active&quot; digital phenotyping assessments (eg, surveys) while geolocation was recorded. RESULTS: Results indicated that SZ patients show less activity than CN and BD, particularly, in their travel from home. Geolocation variables demonstrated convergent validity by small to medium correlations with negative symptoms and functional outcome measured via clinical rating scales, as well as active digital phenotyping behavioral indices of avolition, asociality, and anhedonia. Discriminant validity was supported by low correlations with positive symptoms, depression, and anxiety. Reliability was supported by good internal consistency and moderate stability across days. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide preliminary support for the reliability and validity of geolocation as an objective measure of negative symptoms and functional outcome. Geolocation offers enhanced precision and the ability to take a &quot;big data&quot; approach that facilitates sophisticated computational models. Near-continuous recordings and large numbers of samples may make geolocation a novel outcome measure for clinical trials due to enhanced power to detect treatment effects.;,citation_author=Ian M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mobile Phone Sensor Correlates of Depressive Symptom Severity in Daily-Life Behavior: An Exploratory Study;,citation_abstract=Background: Depression is a common, burdensome, often recurring mental health disorder that frequently goes undetected and untreated. Mobile phones are ubiquitous and have an increasingly large complement of sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring behavioral patterns that might be indicative of depressive symptoms. Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the detection of daily-life behavioral markers using mobile phone global positioning systems (GPS) and usage sensors, and their use in identifying depressive symptom severity. Methods: A total of 40 adult participants were recruited from the general community to carry a mobile phone with a sensor data acquisition app (Purple Robot) for 2 weeks. Of these participants, 28 had sufficient sensor data received to conduct analysis. At the beginning of the 2-week period, participants completed a self-reported depression survey (PHQ-9). Behavioral features were developed and extracted from GPS location and phone usage data. Results: A number of features from GPS data were related to depressive symptom severity, including circadian movement (regularity in 24-hour rhythm; r=-.63, P=.005), normalized entropy (mobility between favorite locations; r=-.58, P=.012), and location variance (GPS mobility independent of location; r=-.58, P=.012). Phone usage features, usage duration, and usage frequency were also correlated (r=.54, P=.011, and r=.52, P=.015, respectively). Using the normalized entropy feature and a classifier that distinguished participants with depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score &amp;amp;amp;#8805;5) from those without (PHQ-9 score &amp;#60;5), we achieved an accuracy of 86.5%. Furthermore, a regression model that used the same feature to estimate the participants&amp;#8217; PHQ-9 scores obtained an average error of 23.5%. Conclusions: Features extracted from mobile phone sensor data, including GPS and phone usage, provided behavioral markers that were strongly related to depressive symptom severity. While these findings must be replicated in a larger study among participants with confirmed clinical symptoms, they suggest that phone sensors offer numerous clinical opportunities, including continuous monitoring of at-risk populations with little patient burden and interventions that can provide just-in-time outreach.;,citation_author=Sohrab Saeb;,citation_author=Mi Zhang;,citation_author=Christopher J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The relationship between clinical, momentary, and sensor-based assessment of depression;,citation_abstract=The clinical assessment of severity of depressive symptoms is commonly performed with standardized self-report questionnaires, most notably the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9), which are usually administered in a clinic. These questionnaires evaluate symptoms that are stable over time. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods, on the other hand, acquire patient ratings of symptoms in the context of their lives. Today’s smartphones allow us to also obtain objective contextual information, such as the GPS location, that may also be related to depression. Considering clinical PHQ-9 scores as ground truth, an interesting question is to what extent the EMA ratings and contextual sensor data can be used as potential predictors of depression. To answer this question, we obtained PHQ-9 scores from 18 participants with a variety of depressive symptoms in our lab, and then collected their EMA and GPS sensor data using their smartphones over a period of two weeks. We analyzed the relationship between GPS sensor features, EMA ratings, and the PHQ-9 scores. While we found a strong correlation between a number of sensor features extracted from the two-week period and the PHQ-9 scores, the other relationships remained non-significant. Our results suggest that depression is better evaluated using long-term sensor-based measurements than the momentary ratings of mental state or short-term sensor information.;,citation_author=Sohrab Saeb;,citation_author=Mi Zhang;,citation_author=Mary Kwasny;,citation_author=Christopher J.

Using geolocation tracking to quantify exploration—variability in daily movement patterns—over a 3-month period in 58 adolescents and adults (ages 13–27) in New York City, we investigated whether daily exploration varied with age and whether exploration related to social connectivity, risk taking, and momentary positive affect. In our cross-sectional sample, we found an association between daily exploration and age, with individuals near the transition to legal adulthood exhibiting the highest exploration levels. Days of higher exploration were associated with greater positive affect irrespective of age. Higher mean exploration was associated with greater social connectivity in all participants but was linked to higher risk taking selectively among adolescents. Our results highlight the interplay of exploration and socioemotional behaviors across development and suggest that societal norms may modulate their expression in naturalistic contexts.;,citation_author=Natalie M.

The FDA currently has approved 3 pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder: acamprosate, naltrexone, and disulfiram. Previous research suggests that there may exist differences in the prevalence of and outcomes related to AUD across sex and racial/ethnic groups. Other work indicates that there may be differences in the efficacy of existing pharmacological treatments for AUD across demographic groups. The purpose of the present study was to examine the inclusion of women and members of minoritized racial/ethnic groups in published randomized clinical trials of pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder since 1994, in accordance with the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993. PubMed was systematically searched using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The initial search located 842 articles. After exclusion of ineligible articles, 102 remained for analysis. Of those included in the review, only 11.8% reported full sex and racial/ethnic characteristics of their study participants. Of the total sample, 6 articles were specifically examining 1 racial/ethnic group, and 11 were specifically examining 1 sex. Two articles (2.2%) did not report information regarding the sex breakdown of their participants, while 47 (49.0%) did not report any information regarding the racial/ethnic breakdown of their sample. Despite guidelines set forth by NIH, only 5.9% of articles conducted subgroup analyses to examine differences in treatment outcomes by sex or race/ethnicity, and only 16.7% of articles included considerations related to cultural inclusion when discussing study limitations. These results varied by medication type.

Multilevel analysis revealed high outlet density associated with segregated counties and predominantly black census tracts in counties with restrictive alcohol policy. This inverse association between policies designed to limit alcohol availability and overconcentration of outlets in black neighborhoods warrants consideration by policymakers given links between outlet density and health inequities.

The current article replicates and extends the 2016 findings on alcohol use disorder (AUD) relapse definitions. Method: We conducted a systematic review of 321 articles that examined relapse in patients with AUD, published from 2000 to 2019. Relapse definitions were extracted and a narrative review of definitions was conducted. Results: One hundred and one different definitions of relapse were used in 251 (78%) of the reviewed articles. In 70 (22%) of articles, no definition of AUD relapse was provided. Fifty-three articles used diagnostic criteria (i.e., alcohol use after remission of AUD), whereas 99 articles defined relapse as “any alcohol use” or “any use of alcohol/drugs.” Additional articles defined relapse by alcohol outcomes (e.g., percent drinking days), alcohol-related problems, or hospitalizations (n = 97). Only 12 articles described the time window of abstinence preceding a relapse. We observed relatively no meaningful intercontinental or time-related differences in relapse definitions, although the outcome “percent heavy drinking days” was used more frequently in recent studies. Conclusions: A wide variety of relapse definitions were identified. Despite decades of research and discussion, there is still no widely accepted consensus definition of AUD relapse. We propose to shift the focus toward clinical continuous outcomes, course specifiers based on the number of AUD symptoms present, and quality-of-life–related criteria instead of using current dichotomous AUD relapse terminology.;,citation_author=Wilco Sliedrecht;,citation_author=Hendrik Roozen;,citation_author=Ranne Waart;,citation_author=Geert Dom;,citation_author=Katie Witkiewitz;,citation_publication_date=2022-03;,citation_cover_date=2022-03;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.15288/jsad.2022.83.248;,citation_issn=1937-1888;,citation_volume=83;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs;,citation_publisher=Alcohol Research Documentation, Inc.;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Review. Psychological and neural mechanisms of relapse;,citation_abstract=Relapse, the resumption of drug taking after periods of abstinence, remains the major problem for the treatment of addiction. Even when drugs are unavailable for long periods or when users are successful in curbing their drug use for extended periods, individuals remain vulnerable to events that precipitate relapse. Behavioural studies in humans and laboratory animals show that drug-related stimuli, drugs themselves and stressors are powerful events for the precipitation of relapse. Molecular, neurochemical and anatomical studies have identified lasting neural changes that arise from mere exposure to drugs and other enduring changes that arise from learning about the relationship between drug-related stimuli and drug effects. Chronic drug exposure increases sensitivity of some systems of the brain to the effects of drugs and stressful events. These changes, combined with those underlying conditioning and learning, perpetuate vulnerability to drug-related stimuli. Circuits of the brain involved are those of the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system and its glutamatergic connections, and the corticotropin-releasing factor and noradrenergic systems of the limbic brain. This paper reviews advances in our understanding of how these systems mediate the effects of events that precipitate relapse and of how lasting changes in these systems can perpetuate vulnerability to relapse.;,citation_author=Jane Stewart;,citation_publication_date=2008-10;,citation_cover_date=2008-10;,citation_year=2008;,citation_issue=1507;,citation_doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0084;,citation_issn=1471-2970;,citation_pmid=18640921;,citation_volume=363;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

In this review, we summarized the existing approaches to smartphone-based HAR. For this purpose, we systematically searched Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science for peer-reviewed articles published up to December 2020 on the use of smartphones for HAR. We extracted information on smartphone body location, sensors, and physical activity types studied and the data transformation techniques and classification schemes used for activity recognition. Consequently, we identified 108 articles and described the various approaches used for data acquisition, data preprocessing, feature extraction, and activity classification, identifying the most common practices, and their alternatives. We conclude that smartphones are well-suited for HAR research in the health sciences. For population-level impact, future studies should focus on improving the quality of collected data, address missing data, incorporate more diverse participants and activities, relax requirements about phone placement, provide more complete documentation on study participants, and share the source code of the implemented methods and algorithms.;,citation_author=Marcin Straczkiewicz;,citation_author=Peter James;,citation_author=Jukka-Pekka Onnela;,citation_publication_date=2021-10;,citation_cover_date=2021-10;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1038/s41746-021-00514-4;,citation_issn=2398-6352;,citation_volume=4;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=npj Digital Medicine;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Epidemiology of Recovery From Alcohol Use Disorder;,citation_abstract=Almost one-third of the U.S. population meets alcohol use disorder (AUD) criteria on a lifetime basis. This review provides an overview of recent research on the prevalence and patterns of alcohol-related improvement and selectively reviews nationally representative surveys and studies that followed risk groups longitudinally with a goal of informing patients with AUD and AUD researchers, clinicians, and policy-makers about patterns of improvement in the population. Based on the research, alcohol use increases during adolescence and early adulthood and then decreases beginning in the mid-20s across the adult life span. Approximately 70% of persons with AUD and alcohol problems improve without interventions (natural recovery), and fewer than 25% utilize alcohol-focused services. Low-risk drinking is a more common outcome in untreated samples, in part because seeking treatment is associated with higher problem severity. Sex differences are more apparent in help-seeking than recovery patterns, and women have lower help-seeking rates than men. Whites are proportionately more likely to utilize services than are Blacks and Hispanics. Improving recovery rates will likely require offering interventions outside of the health care sector to affected communities and utilizing social networks and public health tools to close the longstanding gap between need and utilization of AUD-focused services.;,citation_author=Jalie A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Drinking, Alcohol Use Disorder, and Treatment Access and Utilization Among U.S. Racial/Ethnic Groups;,citation_abstract=Data from approximately 140 articles and reports published since 2000 on drinking, alcohol use disorder ( AUD ), correlates of drinking and AUD , and treatment needs, access, and utilization were critically examined and summarized. Epidemiological evidence demonstrates alcohol-related disparities across U.S. racial/ethnic groups. American Indians/Alaska Natives generally drink more and are disproportionately affected by alcohol problems, having some of the highest rates for AUD . In contrast, Asian Americans are less affected. Differences across Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics are more nuanced. The diversity in drinking and problem rates that is observed across groups also exists within groups, particularly among Hispanics, Asian Americans, and American Indians/Alaska Natives. Research findings also suggest that acculturation to the United States and nativity affect drinking. Recent studies on ethnic drinking cultures uncover the possible influence that native countries’ cultural norms around consumption still have on immigrants’ alcohol use. The reasons for racial/ethnic disparities in drinking and AUD are complex and are associated with historically rooted patterns of racial discrimination and persistent socioeconomic disadvantage. This disadvantage is present at both individual and environmental levels. Finally, these data indicate that admission to alcohol treatment is also complex and is dependent on the presence and severity of alcohol problems but also on a variety of other factors. These include individuals’ sociodemographic characteristics, the availability of appropriate services, factors that may trigger coercion into treatment by family, friends, employers, and the legal system, and the overall organization of the treatment system. More research is needed to understand facilitators and barriers to treatment to improve access to services and support.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The role of daily mobility in mental health inequalities: The interactive influence of activity space and neighbourhood of residence on depression;,citation_abstract=The literature reports an association between neighbourhood deprivation and individual depression after adjustment for individual factors. The present paper investigates whether vulnerability to neighbourhood features is influenced by individual &amp;amp;amp;quot;activity space&amp;quot; (i.e., the space within which people move about or travel in the course of their daily activities). It can be assumed that a deprived residential environment can exert a stronger influence on the mental health of people whose activity space is limited to their neighbourhood of residence, since their exposure to their neighbourhood would be greater. Moreover, we studied the relationship between activity space size and depression. A limited activity space could indeed reflect spatial and social confinement and thus be associated with a higher risk of being depressed, or, conversely, it could be linked to a deep attachment to the neighbourhood of residence and thus be associated with a lower risk of being depressed. Multilevel logistic regression analyses of a representative sample consisting of 3011 inhabitants surveyed in 2005 in the Paris, France metropolitan area and nested within 50 census blocks showed, after adjusting for individual-level variables, that people living in deprived neighbourhoods were significantly more depressed that those living in more advantaged neighbourhoods. We also observed a statistically significant cross-level interaction between activity space and neighbourhood deprivation, as they relate to depression. Living in a deprived neighbourhood had a stronger and statistically significant effect on depression in people whose activity space was limited to their neighbourhood than in those whose daily travels extended beyond it. In addition, a limited activity space appeared to be a protective factor with regard to depression for people living in advantaged neighbourhoods and a risk factor for those living in deprived neighbourhoods. It could therefore be useful to take activity space into consideration more often when studying the social and spatial determinants of depression.;,citation_author=Julie Vallée;,citation_author=Emmanuelle Cadot;,citation_author=Christelle Roustit;,citation_author=Isabelle Parizot;,citation_author=Pierre Chauvin;,citation_publication_date=2011-10;,citation_cover_date=2011-10;,citation_year=2011;,citation_issue=8;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.08.009;,citation_issn=1873-5347;,citation_pmid=21903318;,citation_volume=73;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Social Science &amp;amp; Medicine (1982);">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol-seeking and relapse: A focus on incentive salience and contextual conditioning;,citation_abstract=Environmental stimuli that reliably accompany alcohol intake can become associated with the pharmacological effects of alcohol through classical (Pavlovian) conditioning. Of growing interest to addiction researchers is whether or not this process results in the attribution of incentive salience to alcohol-predictive cues, which could motivate alcohol-seeking behavior and relapse. To evaluate this question, we present a review of rodent behavioral studies that examined the capacity of alcohol-predictive cues to (i) support sign-tracking behavior, (ii) serve as conditioned reinforcers, and (iii) produce Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer. A second, emerging area of research is focused on delineating the role of context in alcohol-seeking behavior and relapse. Here, we review studies showing that alcohol-associated contexts (i) support conditioned place preference, (ii) renew extinguished alcohol-seeking behavior, and (iii) modulate alcohol-seeking responses elicited by discrete alcohol-predictive cues. These behavioral effects may be mediated by unique psychological processes, and have important implications for cue-reactivity studies and neurobiological research.;,citation_author=Milan D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A calibration hierarchy for risk models was defined: From utopia to empirical data;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE: Calibrated risk models are vital for valid decision support. We define four levels of calibration and describe implications for model development and external validation of predictions. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We present results based on simulated data sets. RESULTS: A common definition of calibration is &amp;amp;amp;quot;having an event rate of R% among patients with a predicted risk of R%,&amp;quot; which we refer to as &quot;moderate calibration.&quot; Weaker forms of calibration only require the average predicted risk (mean calibration) or the average prediction effects (weak calibration) to be correct. &quot;Strong calibration&quot; requires that the event rate equals the predicted risk for every covariate pattern. This implies that the model is fully correct for the validation setting. We argue that this is unrealistic: the model type may be incorrect, the linear predictor is only asymptotically unbiased, and all nonlinear and interaction effects should be correctly modeled. In addition, we prove that moderate calibration guarantees nonharmful decision making. Finally, results indicate that a flexible assessment of calibration in small validation data sets is problematic. CONCLUSION: Strong calibration is desirable for individualized decision support but unrealistic and counter productive by stimulating the development of overly complex models. Model development and external validation should focus on moderate calibration.;,citation_author=Ben Van Calster;,citation_author=Daan Nieboer;,citation_author=Yvonne Vergouwe;,citation_author=Bavo De Cock;,citation_author=Michael J.

Individual factors (coping, self-efficacy, resource needs, and expectations for sober fun), social/environmental factors (craving, exposure, negative social influences, and involvement in substance-using leisure activities), and background characteristics measured during treatment were used to predict alcohol and drug use during a 2-year follow-up using manifest variable regression analysis. Results suggest that poorer self-efficacy, greater involvement in substance-using leisure activities, being single, and less income predicted alcohol use directly, whereas greater resource needs and involvement in substance-using leisure activities, being of minority status, and being single predicted drug use directly. Income, gender, problem severity, marital status, and race also predicted alcohol and drug use indirectly.

Ninety-six substance users provided data regarding their perceived risk for relapse, exposure to substances, and involvement in reinforcing activities.

When controlling for confounding variables, aspects of the home settings significantly distinguished abstainers from reusers; perceived risk for relapse was the strongest predictor of reuse. Exposure to substances and involvement in reinforcing activities were not robust reuse indicators. The work and community settings were not significant determinants of reuse. These findings offer some initial support for the utility of examining social settings to better understand addiction relapse and recovery.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A brief review on algorithmic fairness;,citation_abstract=Abstract Machine learning algorithms are widely used in management systems in different fields, such as employee recruitment, loan provision, disease diagnosis, etc., and even in some risky decision-making areas, playing an increasingly crucial role in decisions affecting people’s lives and social development. However, the use of algorithms for automated decision-making can cause unintentional biases that lead to discrimination against certain specific groups. In this context, it is crucial to develop machine learning algorithms that are not only accurate but also fair. There is an extensive discussion of algorithmic fairness in the existing literature. Many scholars have proposed and tested definitions of fairness and attempted to address the problem of unfairness or discrimination in algorithms. This review aims to outline different definitions of algorithmic fairness and to introduce the procedure for constructing fair algorithms to enhance fairness in machine learning. First, this review divides the definitions of algorithmic fairness into two categories, namely, awareness-based fairness and rationality-based fairness, and discusses existing representative algorithmic fairness concepts and notions based on the two categories. Then, metrics for unfairness/discrimination identification are summarized and different unfairness/discrimination removal approaches are discussed to facilitate a better understanding of how algorithmic fairness can be implemented in different scenarios. Challenges and future research directions in the field of algorithmic fairness are finally concluded.;,citation_author=Xiaomeng Wang;,citation_author=Yishi Zhang;,citation_author=Ruilin Zhu;,citation_publication_date=2022-11;,citation_cover_date=2022-11;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1007/s44176-022-00006-z;,citation_issn=2731-5843;,citation_volume=1;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Management System Engineering;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Towards Intersectionality in Machine Learning: Including More Identities, Handling Underrepresentation, and Performing Evaluation;,citation_abstract=Research in machine learning fairness has historically considered a single binary demographic attribute; however, the reality is of course far more complicated. In this work, we grapple with questions that arise along three stages of the machine learning pipeline when incorporating intersectionality as multiple demographic attributes: (1) which demographic attributes to include as dataset labels, (2) how to handle the progressively smaller size of subgroups during model training, and (3) how to move beyond existing evaluation metrics when benchmarking model fairness for more subgroups. For each question, we provide thorough empirical evaluation on tabular datasets derived from the US Census, and present constructive recommendations for the machine learning community. First, we advocate for supplementing domain knowledge with empirical validation when choosing which demographic attribute labels to train on, while always evaluating on the full set of demographic attributes. Second, we warn against using data imbalance techniques without considering their normative implications and suggest an alternative using the structure in the data. Third, we introduce new evaluation metrics which are more appropriate for the intersectional setting.

We explored the inter-relations among the extracted circadian metrics as well as between the circadian metrics and participants’ self-reported mood and sleep outcomes. RESULTS: Compared to GPS signals, smartphone accelerometer activity follows an intradaily distribution that starts earlier in the day, winds down later, reaches half cumulative activity about the same time, conforms less to a sinusoidal wave, and exhibits more intradaily fragmentation but higher CR strength and lower interdaily disruption. We found a notable negative correlation between intradaily variability and CR strength especially pronounced in GPS activity. Self-reported sleep and mood outcomes showed significant correlations with particular CR metrics.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Machine learning models for temporally precise lapse prediction in alcohol use disorder;,citation_abstract=We developed three separate models that provide hour-by-hour probabilities of a future lapse back to alcohol use with increasing temporal precision (i.e., lapses in the next week, next day, and next hour). Model features were based on raw scores and longitudinal change in theoretically implicated risk factors collected through ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Participants (N=151; 51% male; mean age = 41; 87% White, 97% Non-Hispanic) in early recovery (1–8 weeks of abstinence) from alcohol use disorder provided 4x daily EMA for up to three months. We used grouped, nested cross-validation, with 1 repeat of 10-fold cross-validation for the inner loop and 3 repeats of 10-fold cross-validation for the outer loop to train models, select best models, and evaluate those best models on auROC. Models yielded median areas under the receiver operating curves (auROCs) of .90, .91, and .94 in the 30 held-out test sets for week, day, and hour level models, respectively. Some feature categories consistently emerged as being globally important to lapse prediction across our week, day, and hour level models (i.e., past use, future efficacy). However, most of the more punctuate, time varying constructs (e.g., craving, past stressful events, arousal) appear to have greater impact within the next hour prediction model. This research represents an important step toward the development of a smart (machine learning guided) sensing system that can both identify periods of peak lapse risk and recommend specific supports to address factors contributing to this risk. General scientific summary: This study suggests that densely sampled self-report data can be used to predict lapses back to alcohol use with varying degrees of temporal precision.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Leveraging Routine Behavior and Contextually-Filtered Features for Depression Detection among College Students;,citation_abstract=The rate of depression in college students is rising, which is known to increase suicide risk, lower academic performance and double the likelihood of dropping out of school. Existing work on finding relationships between passively sensed behavior and depression, as well as detecting depression, mainly derives relevant unimodal features from a single sensor. However, co-occurrence of values in multiple sensors may provide better features, because such features can describe behavior in context. We present a new method to extract contextually filtered features from passively collected, time-series mobile data via association rule mining. After calculating traditional unimodal features from the data, we extract rules that relate unimodal features to each other using association rule mining. We extract rules from each class separately (e.g., depression vs. non-depression). We introduce a new metric to select a subset of rules that distinguish between the two classes. From these rules, which capture the relationship between multiple unimodal features, we automatically extract contextually filtered features. These features are then fed into a traditional machine learning pipeline to detect the class of interest (in our case, depression), defined by whether a student has a high BDI-II score at the end of the semester. The behavior rules generated by our methods are highly interpretable representations of differences between classes.

These systems rely on complex learning methods and vast amounts of data to optimize the service functionality, satisfaction of the end user and profitability. However, there is a growing concern that these automated decisions can lead, even in the absence of intent, to a lack of fairness, i.e., their outcomes can disproportionately hurt (or, benefit) particular groups of people sharing one or more sensitive attributes (e.g., race, sex). In this paper, we introduce a flexible mechanism to design fair classifiers by leveraging a novel intuitive measure of decision boundary (un)fairness. We instantiate this mechanism with two well-known classifiers, logistic regression and support vector machines, and show on real-world data that our mechanism allows for a fine-grained control on the degree of fairness, often at a small cost in terms of accuracy.;,citation_author=Muhammad Bilal Zafar;,citation_author=Isabel Valera;,citation_author=Manuel Gomez Rogriguez;,citation_author=Krishna P.

        <p>We developed a machine learning model that utilizes geolocation data to predict next-day lapse back to alcohol use. Context- and movement-based features were calculated as raw and change scores for feature engineering. Features were designed to represent clinically-meaningful lapse precursors. One hundred and forty six participants (50.7% male; mean age = 40.9; 87% White, 97.3% Non-Hispanic) in early recovery (1–8 weeks of abstinence) from alcohol use disorder provided continuous geolocation data for up to three months. Inner folds from grouped, nested cross-validation were used to select best models and evaluate the performance of the best performing model. The median area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was .71 across 300 validation sets. Three top performing features emerged: time spent at risky locations, time spent across various types of places, and time spent at locations where alcohol is available. Fairness analyses comparing auROCs across race/ethinicty, age, sex at birth, and income were used to identify the likelihood of differential performance of our model between subgroups within each class. All models exhibited differential performance across subgroups of race/ethnicity, sex at birth, age, and income, such that model performance was worse for non-white, female, and older participants, as well as those below the poverty line. This study represents foundational work carried out to explore predictive signal and important features for future integration into a continuous risk monitoring and support system designed to identify high lapse risk and relevant supports for individuals in recovery.</p>

<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>About 1 in 10 adults in the United States met diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder (AUD) in 2022 <span class="citation" data-cites="samhsacenterforbehavioralhealthstatisticsandqualityHighlights2022National2022">(<a href="#ref-samhsacenterforbehavioralhealthstatisticsandqualityHighlights2022National2022" role="doc-biblioref">SAMHSA Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2022</a>)</span>. Of these individuals, many will experience AUD as a chronic, relapsing disorder marked by periods of recovery interspersed with returns back to harmful use <span class="citation" data-cites="mckayTreatingAlcoholismChronic2011a moosRatesPredictorsRelapse2006">(<a href="#ref-mckayTreatingAlcoholismChronic2011a" role="doc-biblioref">McKay &amp; Hiller-Sturmhofel, 2011</a>; <a href="#ref-moosRatesPredictorsRelapse2006" role="doc-biblioref">Moos &amp; Moos, 2006</a>)</span>. Lapses, or single instances of goal-inconsistent use, necessarily precede a relapse period <span class="citation" data-cites="witkiewitzRelapsePreventionAlcohol2004b">(<a href="#ref-witkiewitzRelapsePreventionAlcohol2004b" role="doc-biblioref">Witkiewitz &amp; Marlatt, 2004</a>)</span>. This temporal precedence combined with their clear definition and ease of observation make them a viable target for early intervention. Yet, even when someone anticipates an oncoming lapse, it may be difficult to pinpoint the specific driving forces behind it. Moreover, the precipitants to a lapse will vary between- and within-people. Both of these factors contribute to the difficulty of maintaining recovery goals.</p>
<!--CP: I took out the end of the first sentence because I feel like it introduced too many concepts at once that are elaborated on later in the paragraph-->
<p>One way to provide ongoing support to individuals in recovery is through the development of a continuous risk monitoring and support system. First, the system must be able to collect risk-relevant data with sufficient temporal granularity. Next, the system should communicate factors driving (or mitigating) this risk to provide personalized recommendations to address that risk (e.g., behavior modification, seeking out supports). Not only does this system need to be developed outright, it also needs to be designed to be both sustainable (i.e., can be used over an extended period of time) and scalable (i.e., can be effectively used by a maximal amount of people). This can be accomplished by integrating personal sensing data and machine learning into its development.</p>
<p>Personal sensing data are data derived via embedded sensors in technology such as smartphones, smartwatches, or wearables <span class="citation" data-cites="mohrPersonalSensingUnderstanding2017a">(<a href="#ref-mohrPersonalSensingUnderstanding2017a" role="doc-biblioref">Mohr et al., 2017</a>)</span>, and can also include information collected via applications downloaded onto one of these devices like ecological momentary assessment (EMA) surveys. Other examples of these data are location information, text messages, and social media behavior. Because these devices are already ubiquitous within our day-to-day lives, these data can feasibly be collected unobtrusively and continuously for clinical purposes. Many of these data do not require individuals to significantly change their behavior or routines in any way, making data collection both sustainable and ecologically valid. Machine learning models can then uncover relationships between antecedent behaviors present in these data and true lapse events. Importantly, the use of machine learning models enables scalability. Continuous and long-term lapse risk detection and accompanying recommendations cannot realistically be provided by clinicians in an already overburdened addiction treatment system <span class="citation" data-cites="mclellanCanNationalAddiction2003">(<a href="#ref-mclellanCanNationalAddiction2003" role="doc-biblioref">McLellan et al., 2003</a>)</span>. Even if not overburdened, risk detection and recommendations could not feasibly be done in real time by clinicians.</p>
<p>Previous work from our group has begun to develop the first part of a continuous risk monitoring and support system by leveraging machine learning to predict alcohol lapse in the next hour, day, and week using data collected via 4x daily EMA <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantMachineLearningModels2023">(<a href="#ref-wyantMachineLearningModels2023" role="doc-biblioref">Wyant et al., 2024</a>)</span>. All models achieved excellent performance (auROCs ~= .9). EMA surveys were designed to capture lapse-relevant constructs about self-efficacy, past use, stress, and mood. This work represents an important first step in the development of a continuous risk monitoring and support system by establishing the ability to generate predictions from sensed data with high accuracy. However, not all contributors to lapse are easily captured within EMA data. If individuals themselves have difficulty identifying lapse precipitants, our systems should not solely rely on self report. Moreover, completing several surveys each day might not be feasible for everyone.</p>
<!--though if we are not doing JIT but only daily updates, EMA is probably fine for that, right?-->
<!--CP: with this, I was thinking more about how capturing info might lose information, even if you're only giving daily updates. Tried to make this idea a little clearer with some new phrasing! Kendra suggested I keep these examples more EMA-centered because I haven't introduced geolocation yet so I also changed those.-->
<p>Perhaps most importantly is the fact that recovery is a dynamic process while EMA, by its very nature, collects data at discrete sampling periods. This may lead to a loss of information, as it assumes that responses remain constant between these periods (e.g., if positive mood is reported at one survey, no shifts in mood are captured until the next survey). Factors that contribute to both maintenance of recovery and lapse events change from person-to-person and from moment-to-moment. A shift in affect may precede a lapse for one individual but not another. Time spent experiencing craving may precede a lapse, but only after a certain threshold is met (i.e., a certain amount of time has been spent craving). In order to best capture this fluidity, the ideal information garnered from personal sensing to be used within a continuous risk monitoring and support system should be able to provide a correspondingly appropriate level of granularity. Geolocation data are one such promising source.</p>
<section id="geolocation-data-for-risk-monitoring" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="geolocation-data-for-risk-monitoring">Geolocation Data for Risk Monitoring</h3>
<p>Geolocation data consist of latitude and longitude coordinates and can be sampled continuously at regular intervals using applications on smartphones, and therefore have greater temporal sensitivity and specificity compared to EMA. Furthermore, the collection of these data requires little to no input from the user beyond initial set-up, while EMA requires repeated daily engagement. In fact, many smartphones and smartwatches automatically collect geolocation data by default. Incorporating geolocation data within a continuous risk monitoring and support system could mean reduced patient burden (i.e., fewer surveys to fill out) and a potentially more equitable system (i.e., easier for people who can’t fill out multiple surveys a day to engage with and, therefore, benefit from). These observations suggest that there is high potential for these data to be feasibly harnessed for improvement upon past risk monitoring work and eventual integration within a larger system.</p>
<p>Beyond the potential benefits geolocation data offer relative to EMA, the importance of location, such as environmental cues or one’s perceived riskiness of a setting, has been shown to play an important role in lapse <span class="citation" data-cites="janakPotentEffectEnvironmental2010 waltonIndividualSocialEnvironmental2003 waltonSocialSettingsAddiction1995">(<a href="#ref-janakPotentEffectEnvironmental2010" role="doc-biblioref">Janak &amp; Chaudhri, 2010</a>; <a href="#ref-waltonSocialSettingsAddiction1995" role="doc-biblioref">Walton et al., 1995</a>; <a href="#ref-waltonIndividualSocialEnvironmental2003" role="doc-biblioref">Walton et al., 2003</a>)</span>. This link with lapse risk has led to integrating coping skills that target substance-associated contexts in several treatment strategies like mindfulness-based relapse prevention <span class="citation" data-cites="lecocqConsideringDrugAssociatedContexts2020">(<a href="#ref-lecocqConsideringDrugAssociatedContexts2020" role="doc-biblioref">LeCocq et al., 2020</a>)</span>. These findings underscore not only the potential wealth of information relating to lapse risk that an individual’s location can provide, but also demonstrate the utility of integrating location information into treatment. Furthermore, geolocation data have been specifically identified as being of particular use in both understanding the precipitants to harmful substance use and its effective treatment <span class="citation" data-cites="stahlerGeospatialTechnologyExposome2013">(<a href="#ref-stahlerGeospatialTechnologyExposome2013" role="doc-biblioref">Stahler et al., 2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Research at the intersection of geolocation and mental health broadly has revealed two broad classes of feature types that can be generated via these data: context-, or place-, based features and movement-based features. Context-based features capture information about the qualities of a particular location, such as associated emotions or characteristics of the surrounding environment. For example, geolocation data paired with ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data have been used to examine the relationship between location and mood in polydrug users (termed “geographical momentary assessment”; <span class="citation" data-cites="epsteinRealtimeTrackingNeighborhood2014a">(<a href="#ref-epsteinRealtimeTrackingNeighborhood2014a" role="doc-biblioref">Epstein et al., 2014</a>)</span>). Geolocation data have also been leveraged to alert individuals when they are approaching a self-identified risky location, such as previously-frequented bar, within recovery-based smartphone applications <span class="citation" data-cites="attwoodUsingMobileHealth2017 carreiroRealizeAnalyzeEngage2021 gustafsonSmartphoneApplicationSupport2014a">(<a href="#ref-attwoodUsingMobileHealth2017" role="doc-biblioref">Attwood et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-carreiroRealizeAnalyzeEngage2021" role="doc-biblioref">Carreiro et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-gustafsonSmartphoneApplicationSupport2014a" role="doc-biblioref">Gustafson et al., 2014</a>)</span>. Other recovery-based apps have expanded upon this by utilizing geolocation data to create “geo-fences” around areas of past use, like past smoking locations, such that individuals receive real-time notifications as they move through their environment (e.g., a pop-up message on a smartphone which reads <em>“You are entering a high-risk zone”</em>; <span class="citation" data-cites="naughtonContextSensingMobilePhone2016">(<a href="#ref-naughtonContextSensingMobilePhone2016" role="doc-biblioref">Naughton et al., 2016</a>)</span>). At a broader level, geolocation data have also been used to examine psychosocial stress exposure among substance users by using location data to obtain composite scores of community SES and crime <span class="citation" data-cites="kwanUncertaintiesGeographicContext2019">(<a href="#ref-kwanUncertaintiesGeographicContext2019" role="doc-biblioref">Kwan et al., 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Movement-based features, on the other hand, quantify individual activity patterns as a way to examine behavioral change. For example, geolocation data have been used to estimate loneliness and isolation through measures of circadian rhythmicity, movement speed, location variance, and clusters of frequently visited locations <span class="citation" data-cites="doryabIdentifyingBehavioralPhenotypes2019a">(<a href="#ref-doryabIdentifyingBehavioralPhenotypes2019a" role="doc-biblioref">Doryab et al., 2019</a>)</span>. Many of these same features, in addition to others such as location entropy (the variability of time spent across significant location clusters), amount of time spent at home, and time spent in transit, have also been used to quantify depressive symptoms <span class="citation" data-cites="saebRelationshipClinicalMomentary2015a saebMobilePhoneSensor2015b">(<a href="#ref-saebRelationshipClinicalMomentary2015a" role="doc-biblioref">Saeb, Zhang, Kwasny, et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-saebMobilePhoneSensor2015b" role="doc-biblioref">Saeb, Zhang, Karr, et al., 2015</a>)</span> and negative symptoms of schizophrenia <span class="citation" data-cites="raughGeolocationDigitalPhenotyping2020">(<a href="#ref-raughGeolocationDigitalPhenotyping2020" role="doc-biblioref">Raugh et al., 2020</a>)</span>. This research has also linked experiential diversity in movement patterns to positive mood <span class="citation" data-cites="hellerAssociationRealworldExperiential2020">(<a href="#ref-hellerAssociationRealworldExperiential2020" role="doc-biblioref">Heller et al., 2020</a>)</span>. Moreover, these data have not only been applied to the measurement of mood symptoms, but to also predict their emergence <span class="citation" data-cites="shinSystematicReviewLocation2023">(for review, see <a href="#ref-shinSystematicReviewLocation2023" role="doc-biblioref">Shin &amp; Bae, 2023</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Despite promising results suggesting that geolocation data can be effectively harnessed to improve our understanding of mental health outcomes broadly and substance use patterns specifically, research has not been done to understand the <em>predictive</em> value of geolocation data in understanding lapses in AUD. Moreover, these context- and movement-based features could be combined and further enriched with brief, intermittent surveys probing specific information about frequently visited locations. Together, some of the more nuanced facets captured within location can be uncovered, such as associations with others (or lack thereof, e.g., social isolation), associations with previous drinking behaviors (e.g., whether or not alcohol is present), and associations with affect (i.e., negative versus positive emotions tied to a given location). Using a combination of these insights in building a model for use within a continuous risk monitoring and support system will result in the ability to identify a wider variety of potential lapse precipitants and, therefore, theoretically perform better across heterogenous experiences of recovery.</p>

<!--why use accuracy as your example metric when you wont report that metric?-->
<!--CP: I used accuracy because I feel like it's a conceptually simple metric to intuit even if you are not a person who is familiar with ML and I want to save my explanation of auROC for the methods! Let me know if that makes sense. Wanted to keep this part less technical!-->
<!-- not clear that the distinction is performance metrics vs. fairness because fairness will also examine performance metrics.  Maybe the distiction is performance overall and peformance differences among subgroups defined by priviledge or disparities?-->
<!--CP: I agree rereading the second paragraph and I expanded on this!-->
<!--measurement? not data selection?-->
<!--CP: yep think that sounds a lot less jargon-y-->
<!--feel like you skipped over excellent overall performance to be used with individuals.  And again, I think fairness is also about good performance, just in subgroups-->
<!--CP: I made some changes to try to address this across both of the two paragraphs, trying to link them with this idea of excellent performance at an overall level and at a group level-->
<p>Measurement, however, is only one component of the successful development of an algorithm for a continuous risk monitoring and support system. It is imperative that these models be rigorously evaluated using performance metrics and eventually tested using independent observations (i.e., using the model to predict outcomes for individuals whose data were not used in development). This workflow in machine learning is what enables researchers to anticipate how well a model can be expected to generalize to new populations and is key when aiming to develop algorithms for real-world healthcare implementation. Ideally, a model designed for implementation in this setting should have overall excellent performance so as to ensure that individuals receive maximally accurate health behavior guidance.</p>
<p>Although performance metrics like model accuracy, for example, have been standard reporting practice for years, recent literature has begun to urge researchers to add assessments of how <em>fair</em> a model <span class="citation" data-cites="rajkomarEnsuringFairnessMachine2018a wawiragichoyaEquityEssenceCall2021">(<a href="#ref-rajkomarEnsuringFairnessMachine2018a" role="doc-biblioref">Rajkomar et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-wawiragichoyaEquityEssenceCall2021" role="doc-biblioref">Wawira Gichoya et al., 2021</a>)</span>. A fair algorithm is one with no preference in performance with respect to inherent or acquired characteristics (e.g., sex at birth, race, socioeconomic status; <span class="citation" data-cites="wangBriefReviewAlgorithmic2022">(<a href="#ref-wangBriefReviewAlgorithmic2022" role="doc-biblioref">X. Wang et al., 2022</a>)</span>). In the context of a continuous risk monitoring algorithm for AUD, this would mean that lapse predictions are reasonably accurate and do not favor or disadvantage any particular group solely due to group membership status. Fairness analyses expand upon the conventional use of performance metrics. Instead of evaluating aggregate performance across all people, these analyses utilize these metrics to probe differential performance between subgroups. These subgroups are typically defined by assumed societal privilege or other known disparities anticipated in a given implementation setting (e.g., dividing subgroups by healthcare access when evaluating a model designed to assess a health outcome). As in an aggregate evaluation of performance, excellent performance in each subgroup is desired.</p>
<p>The motivating factors behind this call to action are clear. In the broader context of health-related data, historical patterns of healthcare inequities will almost certainly and unavoidably be embedded within data used to train algorithms. These inequities may unintentionally be carried forward, and may be exacerbated, by machine learning models if not critically examined. Without a careful eye towards these foreseeable consequences, these algorithms run the risk of providing sub-optimal mental healthcare to individuals who already face disadvantages.</p>

<!--CP: made less techincal per suggestion, talked more explicitly about gaps in literature addressed-->
<p>This study used geolocation data and machine learning to predict next-day lapse in individuals with a diagnosis of AUD and a recovery goal of abstinence in order to address several key gaps in the literature. First, we pursued a novel line of research by using geolocation data to predict lapses, expanding on previous risk monitoring work from our lab using EMA <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantMachineLearningModels2023">(<a href="#ref-wyantMachineLearningModels2023" role="doc-biblioref">Wyant et al., 2024</a>)</span>. Second, we leveraged geolocation features from across the literature that are context- and movement-based in order to cast a wide net across potential precipitants to lapse. Finally, we examined model fairness and in doing so advocate for the use of these analyses to be considered part of standard reporting procedures. This study constitutes an initial evaluation of a model designed to predict lapse back to alcohol use using minimally burdensome data that has the potential to be integrated within a continuous risk monitoring and support system.</p>

<section id="participants" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="participants">Participants</h3>
<p>One hundred and forty six individuals in early-recovery (1-8 weeks of abstinence) for AUD were recruited from the Madison area to take part in a three-month study on how mobile health technology can provide recovery support between 2017 and 2019 (R01 AA024391). Recruitment approaches included social media platforms (e.g., Facebook), television and radio advertisements, and clinic referrals. Prospective participants completed a phone screen to assess match with eligibility criteria (<a href="#tbl-elig" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;1</a>). Participants were excluded if they exhibited severe symptoms of paranoia or psychosis (a score &lt;= 2.24 on the SCL-90 psychosis scale or a score &lt;= 2.82 on the SCL-90 paranoia scale administered at screening). Participants completed a baseline measure of demographics and other constructs relevant to lapse at the screening visit, which was used for fairness assessments (<a href="#tbl-demo-1" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;2</a>).</p>
</section>
<section id="procedure" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="procedure">Procedure</h3>
<p>Participants enrolled in a three-month study consisting of five in-person visits, daily surveys, and continuous passive monitoring of geolocation data. Following screening and enrollment visits in which participants consented to participate, learned how to manage location sharing (i.e., turn off location sharing when desired), and reported frequently visited locations, participants completed three follow-up visits one month apart. At each visit, participants were asked questions about frequently visited (&gt;2 times during the course of the previous month) locations (<a href="#tbl-context" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;3</a>). Participants were debriefed at the third and final follow-up visit. Participants were expected to provide continuous geolocation data while on study. Other personal sensing data streams (EMA, cellular communications, sleep quality, and audio check-ins) were collected as part of the parent grant’s aims (R01 AA024391).</p>
<p>To enable collection of geolocation data, participants downloaded either the Moves app or the FollowMee app during the intake visit. Moves was bought-out and subsequently deprecated while the study was ongoing (July 2018) and data collection continued using FollowMee until the end of the study. Both apps continuously tracked location via GPS and WiFi positioning technology.</p>
<p>After completion of the study, data were processed to filter out duplicated points, fast movement speeds (&gt;100mph), sudden positional jumps, and periods of long duration suggesting sampling error issues (&gt;24 hours with no movement or &gt;2 hours with a positional jump of more than 0.31 miles or 500 meters). Data points were classified as “in transit” when spacing between individual positions suggested a movement speed of greater than 4mph per NIH health guidelines <span class="citation" data-cites="u.s.departmentofhealthandhumanservicesPhysicalActivityGuidelines2018">(<a href="#ref-u.s.departmentofhealthandhumanservicesPhysicalActivityGuidelines2018" role="doc-biblioref">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2018</a>)</span>.

<p>Alcohol lapses were used as the outcome variable in this study and were used to provide labels for model training, for testing model performance, and for testing issues of algorithmic fairness. Future lapse occurrence (here conceptualized as next-day lapse) was predicted in 24-hour windows, beginning at 4:00am on a participant’s second day of participation to ensure one full day of data collection for the first window, and at every subsequent day on study thereafter. <em>Lapse</em> and <em>no lapse</em> occurrences were identified from the daily survey question, <em>“Have you drank any alcohol that you have not yet reported?”</em>. Participants who responded <em>yes</em> to this question were then asked to report the date and hour of the start and the end of the drinking episode. In this case, the prediction window was labeled <em>lapse</em>. Prediction windows were labeled <em>no lapse</em> if no alcohol use was reported within that window.</p>

<section id="input-variables-feature-engineering" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="input-variables-feature-engineering">Input variables: Feature engineering</h3>
<p>Feature engineering is the process of creating variables (or <em>“features”</em>) from unprocessed data and was used to transform raw data from geolocation data collected the prior day. Separate feature categories were created for the six contextual geolocation categories (presented in <a href="#tbl-context" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;3</a>) and for three movement-based categories: variability in location, time spent outside of the home in the evening, and time spent in transit. All features were calculated both as raw (i.e., summed duration over past 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 168 hour periods) and change features (i.e., relative to all previous geolocation data) in order to capture individual variation. This resulted in a total of 746 features.</p>

<section id="algorithm-development-performance" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="algorithm-development-performance">Algorithm development &amp; performance</h3>
<p>We trained and assessed several configurations of an XGBoost machine learning algorithm. The choice of using an XGBoost algorithm was motivated by two main reasons: 1) the calculation of Shapley values, used to understand the relative contributions of features in predictions, is optimized for XGBoost; and 2) previous work in our lab has made use of XGBoost algorithms in model development <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantMachineLearningModels2023">(<a href="#ref-wyantMachineLearningModels2023" role="doc-biblioref">Wyant et al., 2024</a>)</span> and the ability to eventually integrate features across models is of high priority. Configurations of the XGBoost algorithm varied across a relevant and appropriate range of model-specific hyperparameters (mtry, tree depth, learning rate) as well as resampling techniques (up-sampling of the positive class, lapse, and down-sampling of the negative class, no lapse ranging from 1:1 to 5:1) to account for the class imbalance in our outcome variable.</p>
<p>Models were trained and assessed using 10 x 30 participant-grouped, nested <em>k</em>-fold cross-validation. Grouped cross-validation ensures that all data from a given participant are retained as either held-in or held-out. This prevents the introduction of bias from a participant’s data being used to predict their own data. Nested cross-validation uses two nested loops for dividing and holding out folds: an outer loop, where held-out folds serve as test sets for model evaluation; and inner loops, where held-out folds serve as validation sets for model selection <span class="citation" data-cites="jonathanUseCrossvalidationAssess2000">(<a href="#ref-jonathanUseCrossvalidationAssess2000" role="doc-biblioref">Jonathan et al., 2000</a>)</span>. Results from the 300 validation sets (i.e., inner loops) are presented here. Test set performance has not been evaluated because model development is still in progress. Test set evaluation is reserved for the completed model to minimize overfitting and is carried out using data which were not used to train or validate the model.</p>
<!--CP: moved up addressing why we are assessing validation and not test sets to here and not just in the results section-->
<p>The primary performance metric for model selection and evaluation of the validation set was area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (auROC) curve <span class="citation" data-cites="kuhnAppliedPredictiveModeling2018">(<a href="#ref-kuhnAppliedPredictiveModeling2018" role="doc-biblioref">Kuhn &amp; Johnson, 2018</a>)</span>. auROC indexes the probability that the model will predict a higher score for a randomly selected positive case (lapse) relative to a randomly selected negative case (no lapse). The overall percentage of lapses across all observations (each day per participant on study) was 7.9%, motivating the selection of this metric as it is unaffected by class imbalance. The best model configuration was selected using median auROC across all <em>validation</em> sets. The same median value was used to index the performance of the best model configuration. As a result, there is potential for optimization bias, or overfitting, in these results such that our model may appear to be performing better than it might be expected to with independent data. However, it should be minimal given that there are 300 folds. Test sets will eventually be used to evaluate final model performance in order to remove any potential optimization bias from our performance estimate. <!--CP: added in explanation of optimization bias--></p>
<!--still not really situated in the study.  Why do we care?-->
<!--CP: remove use of phrase interpretability metric-->
<p>Shapley values were computed in log-odd units in order to evaluate global importance of each of the features. Shapley values measure the unique contribution of features in an algorithm’s predictions and therefore identify the relative importance of difference features <span class="citation" data-cites="lundbergUnifiedApproachInterpreting2017">(<a href="#ref-lundbergUnifiedApproachInterpreting2017" role="doc-biblioref">Lundberg &amp; Lee, 2017</a>)</span>. Global feature importance for each broad feature category was calculated by averaging the absolute values of Shapley values across all observations per feature category. Highly important features represent relevant, actionable potential antecedents to lapse (and therefore points of intervention) that will be relevant in the future development of a fully integrated continuous risk monitoring and support system. However, these are descriptive analyses because standard errors or other indices of uncertainty for important scores are not available for Shapley values. Moreover, even low global features may be an important contributor to lapse, and therefore motivate intervention, for a specific person at a specific time (i.e., high local importance).</p>
<p>A Bayesian hierarchical generalized linear model was used to estimate the posterior probability distributions of auROCs. The median posterior probability for auROC and Bayesian credible intervals (CIs) are reported as an evaluation of the model’s overall performance. We used a threshold of auROC = .5 (chance performance) when examining CIs, such that a CI that does not contain .5 indicates performance above chance and therefore predictive signal in the data. <!--CP: added more detail!--></p>

<p>Classes for fairness analyses were defined on the basis of personal individual characteristics divided such that subgroups reflected coarse dichotomies of groups which experience relatively increased and decreased societal privilege.</p>
<p>This resulted in four broad classes: white versus non-white, younger than 55 versus equal to or older than 55, above or below the federal poverty line <span class="citation" data-cites="bartels2024FederalPoverty2024">(<a href="#ref-bartels2024FederalPoverty2024" role="doc-biblioref">Bartels, 2024</a>)</span>, and sex at birth (male versus female). A Bayesian hierarchical generalized linear model was used to estimate the posterior probability distributions of auROCs and corresponding 95% Bayesian CIs across these four classes.</p>

<p>A total of 192 individuals were eligible to participate in the study, of which 191 consented to participate and 169 enrolled in the study. Fifteen participants were excluded prior to the first monthly follow-up visit. One participant was excluded for not maintaining a recovery goal of abstinence during their time on study. Two participants were excluded due to evidence of low compliance and careless responding. A further five individuals were excluded due to poor geolocation data quality as a result of insufficient data (resulting from software incompatibility), resulting in a final sample size of 146.</p>
<p>The average age of the final sample was 40.9 years (SD = 12 years, range = 21-72 years). There was an approximately equal number of men (n = 74, 50.7%) and women (n = 72, 49.3%). The majority of the sample was White/Caucasian (n = 127, 86.99%) and non-Hispanic (n = 142, n = 97%). The mean income of participants was $34,408 (SD = $32,259, range = $0-$200,000).

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-evaluation-1">Model Evaluation</h3>
<p>We selected and evaluated the best performing XGBoost model across all 300 validation sets. This may result in a slight optimization bias in our model performance, though we believe this is largely offset through our use of 10 x 30 cross-validation (which averages model performance across 300 folds). Cross-validation maintains separation between data used to train the models, select the best models, and evaluate those best models, thereby minimizing overfitting <span class="citation" data-cites="jonathanUseCrossvalidationAssess2000">(<a href="#ref-jonathanUseCrossvalidationAssess2000" role="doc-biblioref">Jonathan et al., 2000</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The median auROC over all validation sets was 0.712. This indicates that the model correctly assigns a higher probability of lapse to a positive case (rather than a negative case) 0.712 of the time. <a href="#fig-auroc-histogram" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a> displays a histogram of model performance distribution and <a href="#fig-auroc-plot" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a> displays a receiver operating characteristic curve representing aggregate predicted lapse probabilities across all folds. <!--ROC curve should be earlier when you are still focusing on auROC.  Maybe along with the histograms to characteristic the validation data.--><!--CP: better here?--></p>
<p>Posterior probability distributions for the auROCs for our best performing validation set model were then used to formally characterize model performance. The median auROC was 0.714 (95% CI [0.70-0.73]) with a probability of 1.000 that the model is performing above chance (i.e., auROC &gt; .5; <a href="#fig-pp" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3</a>). <!--CP: note to self to fix this pp tidy object, this gets the correct result but should actually be pulling the mean from all posteriors --></p>
<p>Additionally, model calibration was performed in order to improve our trust in model predictions because XGBoost is not a probabilistic model. Results of model calibration are displayed in <a href="#fig-calibration" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;4</a>, showing that this model <em>over</em> predicts lapse probability even after calibrating the model. In other words, our model is more likely to predict that an individual will lapse than the true observed rate of lapse in our sample. Despite this, calibrated probabilities are ordinal and sufficiently linear, suggesting that these scores may be useful for relative risk comparisons but not for exact lapse probabilities. <!--CP: added suggested expansion, not sure if I should port it down to the discussion section--></p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-performance">Model Performance</h3>
<p>Our day-level model of lapse prediction using geolocation data has a median auROC of 0.714. Bayesian model comparisons indicated that this model performed better than chance (auROC = .5). While not clinically implementable on its own, these findings confirm that there is strong evidence of predictive signal in these data and are an important first step towards an eventual continuous risk monitoring and support system. This study also provided explanatory insights by way of quantifying feature importance as well as a crucial examination of model fairness across classes, detailed in the following section.</p>
<p>Model calibration is the process of fine-tuning model predictions to more closely align with the true likelihood of a given outcome and was carried out in order to improve our trust in model predictions (in this case, to better align model predictions against the observed lapse rate in our sample; <span class="citation" data-cites="dormannCalibrationProbabilityPredictions2020">(<a href="#ref-dormannCalibrationProbabilityPredictions2020" role="doc-biblioref">Dormann, 2020</a>)</span>). Yet, even following calibration, our model overpredicts occurrence of lapses in our sample. Two potential solutions would be to explore other calibration methods outside of logistic calibration, such as beta calibration, and to examine the distribution of our feature set. Typically class imbalances result in an overprediction of the majority class and not the minority class (here, we would expect an overprediction of no lapses relative to lapses). Instead, we see the opposite. This may be because our features favor the minority class. For example, time spent at risky locations, our most predictive feature, is a unipolar scale that is focused on the <em>riskiness</em> and not the <em>protectiveness</em> of a location. <!--CP: I had a different paper in here that was talking about refitting a model - I went back and reread the paper and realized it was regression focused, so refitting = re-estimating parameters. Removed because not relevant!--></p>
<p>In general, achieving perfect calibration is unrealistic, as it implies that the model is completely accurate given the selected predictors <span class="citation" data-cites="vancalsterCalibrationHierarchyRisk2016">(<a href="#ref-vancalsterCalibrationHierarchyRisk2016" role="doc-biblioref">Van Calster et al., 2016</a>)</span>. This is not to say that calibration is not important, but rather that it needs to be completed to the extent to which, in a real-world setting, feedback being given to individuals from the model is not causing unnecessary harm. Moreover, some oversensitivity may not be an issue depending on what information we hope to relay to individuals using a continuous risk monitoring and support system. In the future development of such a system, we are not necessarily interested in communicating exact probabilities to individuals about their lapse risk (such as, <em>“There is a 92% chance that you lapse back to use today”</em>). Rather, we are more interested in communicating <em>relative</em> levels of risk (such as, <em>“You are at a low risk level of lapse today,”</em> or, <em>“Your risk of lapse is higher this week compared to last week”</em> where <em>low risk</em> corresponds to a designated probability threshold).</p>
<p>We used Shapley values to quantify global feature importance. The top performing Shapley values were time spent at risky locations, time spent at different location types (e.g., home, bars, work), and time spent at locations with varying levels of alcohol availability. Time spent at risky locations was associated with a 2x <em>greater</em> log-odds change in lapse risk as compared to the next highest performing feature of time spent at different location types. These results are well-aligned with the extant AUD literature, notably the focus of high-risk situations as an immediate determinant to relapse within the relapse prevention model <span class="citation" data-cites="larimerRelapsePreventionOverview1999b marlattRelapsePreventionMaintenance1985">(<a href="#ref-larimerRelapsePreventionOverview1999b" role="doc-biblioref">Larimer et al., 1999</a>; <a href="#ref-marlattRelapsePreventionMaintenance1985" role="doc-biblioref">Marlatt &amp; Gordon, 1985</a>)</span>. These three features were all generated utilizing additional context supplied by participants after a given location was identified as frequently visited (&gt; 2x in the previous month). However, it should be noted that these features may be able to be generated without user feedback. For example, location types could be classified using public map data and consumer data could be used to identify establishments that sell alcohol. This could further reduce the burden on an individual using a continuous risk monitoring and support system by not requiring individual input. On the other hand, self-classifying locations as risky might be encoding nuance that could not be feasibly obtained using public data. For instance, a location might be labeled as risky from user input because it is a person-specific triggering location (e.g., scene of a traumatic event).</p>
<!--CP: I expanded on some of the ideas I had in this paragraph to hopefully make them clearer-->
<p>Interestingly, location valence, or the emotion tied to a given location, is the fourth-highest Shapley value, yet appears to be minimally contributing to model predictions. This may be because participants were asked retrospectively about these locations at one month follow-up visits, and so our measures of emotional quality of a location may be too temporally distant to be meaningful. Moreover, these were static and could not account for changes in a location’s emotional quality over time. While other measures of global feature importance were low, these features may still be important for a particular prediction at a specific point in time and may be of use in a continuous risk monitoring and support system.</p>

<p>All models exhibited differential performance across subgroups of race/ethnicity, sex at birth, age, and income, such that model performance was worse for non-white, female, and older participants, as well as those below the poverty line. There are at least two clear pathways whereby algorithmic performance may diverge between subgroups. The first is non-representative sampling. During model training, an algorithm learns to associate patterns in observations with a given outcome. Model performance will therefore suffer if there is limited information from which to learn (e.g., few instances of a given demographic trait; <span class="citation" data-cites="japkowiczClassImbalanceProblem2000">Japkowicz (<a href="#ref-japkowiczClassImbalanceProblem2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>)</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="wangIntersectionalityMachineLearning2022">A. Wang et al. (<a href="#ref-wangIntersectionalityMachineLearning2022" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>). For instance, even collapsing across dichotomous categories for both race and ethnicity (i.e., white and non-Hispanic and non-white and/or Hispanic), our non-white and/or Hispanic sample only reflects 13% of the total sample. Outside of recruiting a more diverse sample in future studies, one potential solution is to synthetically up-sample cases of the minority class (in this case, non-white participants) such that the model has more data on which to base its predictions <span class="citation" data-cites="kabirBalancingFairnessUnveiling2024">(<a href="#ref-kabirBalancingFairnessUnveiling2024" role="doc-biblioref">Kabir et al., 2024</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Yet, we also see divergent performance across men and women in our sample, a class that <em>is</em> well-balanced (<em>N</em> male = 74, <em>N</em> female = 72). This may be due to how constructs of AUD have been conceptualized. Similar to other areas of psychology, the AUD literature has historically been built upon research developed with male, predominantly white, participants. Despite the call to action brought forth by the NIH through their <em>Guidelines on Inclusion of Women and Minorities in Research</em>, recent work has highlighted that seminal research in the field on medications for the treatment of AUD have failed to consistently report participant demographics <span class="citation" data-cites="schickCallActionSystematic2020">(<a href="#ref-schickCallActionSystematic2020" role="doc-biblioref">Schick et al., 2020</a>)</span>. This lack of reporting makes it difficult to assess how and if this lack of representation is being corrected. By the very nature of its historically limited participant pool, AUD research and its theory have been developed from a particular perspective using a limited group of individuals. This means that the variables that researchers decide are important to measure and input into models, informed by knowledge of AUD theory, will inherently be biased and may favor these groups. Our features may not be as salient of predictors for lapse for women as they are for men, resulting in the differences in auROCs that we see here. This underscores the importance of <em>procedural</em> fairness (i.e., considering the fairness of feature inputs themselves) in addition to outcome fairness <span class="citation" data-cites="grgic-hlacaDistributiveFairnessAlgorithmic2018">(<a href="#ref-grgic-hlacaDistributiveFairnessAlgorithmic2018" role="doc-biblioref">Grgić-Hlača et al., 2018</a>)</span>. Using this <em>means</em> and <em>ends</em> approach may result in a more refined understanding of different facets impacting performance across groups.</p>
<p>If maintaining a top-down approach to feature selection from the literature is a primary goal, more research will need to be done to create a better understanding of AUD experiences and recovery for specific groups who have historically been under-studied in this area. There have been several recent calls to action with respect to studying AUD across sex suggesting that factors which precipitate lapse and contribute to recovery maintenance may be different for women as compared to men <span class="citation" data-cites="mccaulAlcoholWomenBrief2019 mccradyTreatmentInterventionsWomen2020">(<a href="#ref-mccaulAlcoholWomenBrief2019" role="doc-biblioref">McCaul et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-mccradyTreatmentInterventionsWomen2020" role="doc-biblioref">McCrady et al., 2020</a>)</span>. Alternatively, bottom-up approaches, such as allowing an algorithm to identify patterns in the data that are most predictive of lapse, may get around issues of bringing in biased features from the literature. This may be at the expense of generating features that are not easily clinically translatable or particularly meaningful. Together, these results suggest that we are seeing the aftereffects of both statistical bias (i.e., inadequate sampling) and societal bias (i.e., constructs which are of limited value to certain groups) in our model <span class="citation" data-cites="mitchellAlgorithmicFairnessChoices2021">(<a href="#ref-mitchellAlgorithmicFairnessChoices2021" role="doc-biblioref">Mitchell et al., 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>While it is important to consider ways to remedy this in our model so that it may be able to be equitably used in the real-world, it is also important to note that the goal of this work is not to suggest that quantitative definitions of fairness are sufficient to fix deeply rooted issues of societal injustice <span class="citation" data-cites="greenEscapingImpossibilityFairness2022 greenMythMethodologyRecontextualization2018 ochigameLongHistoryAlgorithmic2020">(<a href="#ref-greenEscapingImpossibilityFairness2022" role="doc-biblioref">Green, 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-greenMythMethodologyRecontextualization2018" role="doc-biblioref">Green &amp; Hu, 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-ochigameLongHistoryAlgorithmic2020" role="doc-biblioref">Ochigame, 2020</a>)</span>.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="additional-limitations-and-future-directions">Additional limitations and future directions</h3>
<p>This study is an important step forward in building a model using geolocation data to predict next-day lapse back to drinking in individuals with a diagnosis of AUD and a recovery goal of abstinence. However, there are several limitations to this work.</p>
<p>First, our model has only a fair level of performance. A simple strategy to improve this is to explore additional features. Risk-relevant features that can be generated without additional participant-supplied contextual information include geographical spatial risk indicators and circadian rhythm data. Risk-terrain modeling is a spatial analysis technique which enables the estimation of environmental risk factors on a given outcome, such as contact with high liquor outlet density or high crime areas preceding lapse <span class="citation" data-cites="gajosUsingRiskTerrain2024">(<a href="#ref-gajosUsingRiskTerrain2024" role="doc-biblioref">Gajos et al., 2024</a>)</span>. Circadian rhythm data, on the other hand, can be extracted using a Lomb-Scargle periodogram to derive the spectrum of geolocation data, therefore quantifying the (ir)regularity of daily activity <span class="citation" data-cites="vanderplasUnderstandingLombScargle2018">(<a href="#ref-vanderplasUnderstandingLombScargle2018" role="doc-biblioref">VanderPlas, 2018</a>)</span>. Circadian rhythm patterns derived from geolocation data have been widely used in the affective science literature for predicting mood <span class="citation" data-cites="chikersalDetectingDepressionPredicting2021 saebMobilePhoneSensor2015b saebRelationshipClinicalMomentary2015a">(<a href="#ref-chikersalDetectingDepressionPredicting2021" role="doc-biblioref">Chikersal et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-saebMobilePhoneSensor2015b" role="doc-biblioref">Saeb, Zhang, Karr, et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-saebRelationshipClinicalMomentary2015a" role="doc-biblioref">Saeb, Zhang, Kwasny, et al., 2015</a>)</span>. Moreover, encouraging the maintenance of a daily routine may be helpful in the context of AUD recovery specifically <span class="citation" data-cites="huhneDAILYPersonalizedCircadian2021 tamuraCircadianRhythmsSubstance2021">(<a href="#ref-huhneDAILYPersonalizedCircadian2021" role="doc-biblioref">Hühne et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-tamuraCircadianRhythmsSubstance2021" role="doc-biblioref">Tamura et al., 2021</a>)</span>. These features are not only clinically meaningful, but are also clinically <em>intervenable</em>. In the context of a continuous risk monitoring and support system, individuals could receive notifications relating to increasing amounts of time spent in riskier areas (beyond self-identified risky locations) or irregularity of movement patterns suggesting circadian disruption. Potential interventions in these examples would be to suggest relocating to a “safer” area or encouraging following a more regular schedule. We might also be interested in features that, while not being clinically-actionable, may add more predictive value to our model by increasing precision. Examples of such features are day of the week and weather, two factors that contribute to daily behavior and thus geolocation data <span class="citation" data-cites="hellerAssociationRealworldExperiential2020">(<a href="#ref-hellerAssociationRealworldExperiential2020" role="doc-biblioref">Heller et al., 2020</a>)</span>. <!--I dont know that you have adequately set people up to know why link between features and intervention is immportant.  You described your models providinng risk monitorinng but never really talked about their role personalizing recommmendations.--> <!--CP: you mentioned that I hadn't set up the link between features and intervention -- I didn't change this paragraph but instead opted to expand more on that idea in the introduction. Let me know if that makes this lead-up better!!--></p>
<p>Secondly, we assessed auROCs from our validation sets against chance performance (auROC = .5). While this is an important standard to meet as it indicates these data have strong predictive signal, it may be beneficial to also design a baseline model against which to compare performance for two reasons. First, a more rigorous model contrast will set a higher standard with which to evaluate our model against prior to implementation in a real-world context. Second, it will give us insight if the same level of prediction can be achieved using a simpler model. <!--CP: you asked why doing a different comparison would be beneficial,let me know if my intuition seems correct here. I tried to rephrase a few of the sentences--> For example, we could compare the predictive power of our model against a model which predicts future lapse from past lapse behavior <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantMachineLearningModels2023">(as in <a href="#ref-wyantMachineLearningModels2023" role="doc-biblioref">Wyant et al., 2024</a>)</span>. Alternatively, we might be interested in comparing our model against another model using more simplistic features that we think might be related to both geolocation patterns and drinking behavior, such as a model which uses day of the week to predict lapse.</p>
<p>Next, we have examined the feature importance and have identified three geolocation features that appear to be strongly predictive of next-day lapse: time spent at risky locations, time spent across various types of places, and time spent at locations where alcohol is available. These features are collapsed across particular response-types and across time periods. A first next step will be to break down these top performing features into their subcomponents, such as looking at the contributions of time spent at high, medium, and low risk locations to lapse predictions separately. It may also be of value to look at particular time points. Duration features in this model were calculated at intervals starting from 6 hours prior up until 168 hours prior. In the context of geolocation data, it may be interesting to more closely examine more proximal as opposed to distal time points. These two avenues are both still at the global (i.e., across all subjects) level of feature importance. We can also examine how these features perform at an individual level for a given prediction to get a sense of how stable they are over time, within and between people.</p>
<p>Finally, following final evaluation using an independent test set, a future direction of this work is to integrate the most-predictive features derived from this geolocation-based model with features from the EMA-based model designed within our lab <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantMachineLearningModels2023">(<a href="#ref-wyantMachineLearningModels2023" role="doc-biblioref">Wyant et al., 2024</a>)</span>. These two studies represent foundational work carried out to explore predictive signal and important features across distinct data sources. The day-level EMA model performed better than the geolocation model, achieving an auROC of 0.90. However, both models appear to be contributing unique features of interest in predicting lapse which suggests that they may provide complementary information about lapse risk. For example, the top three day-level features using EMA were past use, future efficacy (i.e., belief in oneself to maintain recovery goals), and craving. These are qualitatively distinct from time spent at risky locations, time spent across various types of places, and time spent at locations where alcohol is available. Features explored across both of these models will be integrated and used to optimize the development of a continuous risk monitoring and support system for AUD in a recently funded grant, where individuals will also receive temporally relevant feedback on features driving their risk of lapse (1R01AA031762-01).</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This study demonstrates that it is feasible to predict lapse with a fair level of accuracy using geolocation data, suggesting that geolocation data is a viable supplement for a continuous risk monitoring and support system. However, our model demonstrates differential performance across vulnerable subgroups. Moving forward, additional risk-relevant features will be added to the model in an effort to improve prediction and the final model will be evaluated.</p>
