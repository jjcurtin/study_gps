    "-   Need to figure out what threshold of missing data to tolerate when doing CM calculations. lsp() function only needs 3 data points but we definitely need more than that to accurately calculate spectra. Currently have the threshold set to 42 (which would be about a sample every 4 hours). Biological rhythms research is sparse on this, but the conclusion seems to be “the more the better”!\n",

    "-   Created a new file which combines gps features, weather features, and the stratification file to create a combine features file. This file is in data_processed/gps. Eventually will need to add in circadian movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Worked more on processing circadian movement. Turns out there’s only about 3% of missing data, and there are certain subjects who have more missing data than others. Next step is to explore interpolation options or potentially nixing some subjects.\n",

    "-   After rerunning GPS features on 6/10 (v6), noticed that community space / recreation, public drinking space, temporary residence, and travel stop all have 0s for p0 p50 p100 – I suspect this has to do with spacing in variable names. I checked and this was also the case with the previous version of features, so I’m also guessing this hasn’t been caught before. Confirmed has to do with spacing.\n",

    "-   V7 GPS features were checked and saved out. Now there are no features that are all 0s!\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Weather features were generated (generated very fast so ask John about how to string batches together better so CHTC doesn’t get mad at me). The features look fine, but there are some very low temps (checked in the weather raw file and confirmed those exist so it’s not a calculation error). Note to manually check the weather for some of those days as a sanity check.\n",

    "-   Had the thought that maybe cal_estimate_beta() is modifying the inputs to beta_calibration() in some way prior to passing it into the function and perhaps that is why I am having difficulty replicating. Did some sleuthing and looks like this is the case. cal_estimate_beta() changes the outcome variable from a factor to numeric prior to passing it in to beta_calibration(). Adding that in to my code enables me to reproduce the error.\n",
